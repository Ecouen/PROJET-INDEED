Le(la) stagiaire devra reprogrammer le code C d’un micro-controlleur dans le capteur qui tourne sur un FPGA pour le rendre plus versatile, et mettre a jour en même temps le code C de la machine Linux.
Les deux logiciels effectuent du traitement numérique du signal de données radar et doivent à la fin afficher des images radar (Range-Doppler, bird-view, micro-doppler...)
Une fois les logiciels a un niveau suffisant de maturité, le(la) stagiaire devra ajouter une caméra (mono voire stéréo) pour capturer des images vidéo en même temps que les données radar, les stocker de façon synchrone grâce au langage ROS (Robot Operating System) et python ou C++ et écrire un logiciel pour superposer images camera et radar sous ROS.

Context
The NXP 77GHz radar team in Toulouse is in charge of defining, validating and designing integrated circuits for automotive radar to enable on-car radar towards autonomous cars.
The team is looking for a software engineer to capture and process radar data.
Missions
The intern charter will be to take care of the following tasks:
Continue writing software on PC (Python, matlab) that was started by a previous intern, and possibly some code on NXP MCUs specialized in radar signal processing (S32R family) in C language that exists to capture data from the sensors.
Use and improve the software from a high performance Imaging radar (C language) and its capture software running on Linux machine based on multi-core GPU processor. The intern will have to re-program the code of a micro-controller in the sensor that is running on an FPGA to make it more versatile, and update at the same time the C code from the Linux machine.
Both software perform digital signal processing on radar data and must ultimately display radar images (Range-Doppler, bird-view, micro-doppler...)
Once the radar capture softwares are to an adequate level, the intern will have to add a camera to capture images at the same time as radar data, store them in a synchronous way (ROS language) and write software to overlay camera and radar images.
Profile
Educational level : Master thesis, last year in french engineering school in computer science with, knowledge of digital signal processing theory, programming languages (matlab, C, Python, Ros…) and interest in radar sensor, micro-controllers and automotive.
