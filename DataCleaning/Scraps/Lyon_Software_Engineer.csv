Description du sujet
The Collaborative Design group of G-SCOP laboratory at Grenoble Institute of Technology is looking for a a PhD candidate to take active part in the Open!Next Horizon2020 European project. The project Open!Next – which gathers research centres (Grenoble INP/G-SCOP, TU Berlin, University of Bath), co-creation facilities (Fablab Berlin, Underbroen/Maker, Waag society, Dansk Design Center), product data management organisations (Fraunhofer IPK, Wikimedia DE, Wikifactory Ltd), and enterprises (OpcTec Gmbh, Styjja, Sono Motors Gmbh) – aims at enabling small and medium-sized enterprises to engage in company-community-collaboration for means of development and market exploitation of open source hardware products and related-services.

Your Task
The design of Open Source Hardware (OSH) product and related-services relies on the extensive use of models engineered with computer-aided technologies (MBSE, CAD, CAE, CFD, CAM, virtual and augmented reality, point clouds from 3D scanning, reverse engineering…).
Cloud-based open source platforms such as Wikifactory for hardware or GitHub for software enable open source communities to host and share engineering artefacts (code, models, bill of materials, assembly instructions, videos…), manage projects, and build open source products.
However, so far, the reuse of the design artefacts required to recreate or modify products is often challenging because most design knowledge (assumptions, rules, choices…) remains tacit knowledge (e.g. commonsense) or unrecognised knowledge (e.g. expertise and skill). When one access the repository of an open source project, the quantity of recognised and codified knowledge in models is relatively limited. Indeed, in most cases, the repository only includes a snapshot of the solution at a given time, that is, a set of models, codes, and documents without the underlying design rationales that conducted to the actual solution. The lack of organisation and traceability in the design process of open source hardware makes the reuse of models and the collaboration between companies and maker communities difficult. The OPEN!NEXT project ambitions to develop a platform based on Wikimedia technology that could guide and support the design communities through development standards and models for optimising the reuse of existing designs among and across the communities. The PhD candidate will take an active part in this effort in collaboration with the other involved partners.
The PhD candidate will conduct research on a framework to build project memories during the model-based design of open source hardware in order to facilitate design reuse. The framework will rely on methodological recommendations, computer-aided technologies, and experimental based-analysis research to capture and reuse knowledge. The main deliverable of this research project will be an ontological standard for the design of open source hardware and its related services, providing a precise characterization of the “source” of hardware. The framework will intend to blend the agility of makers community with the traceability processes of industrial companies so as to create the necessary conditions of an effective and efficient collaboration in creative and productive opens source hardware ecosystems.

Our offer
We offer good working conditions within the G-SCOP laboratory and access to state-of-the-art engineering and experimental facilities. The position is fully funded through fixed-term contract. Position available mid-September 2019.

Well-motivated and highly-qualified students from all countries will be considered.

Job Details
Software Engineer Internship Program France - 6 months

Start date: 1 February
Duration: 6 months
Location : Grenoble

This is your time to shine! Salesforce is now hiring top talent to join our Futureforce into different departments for a 6 month internship starting on the first of February. Whether you are coming from a technical or creative background, we’d like to hear from you to help you develop your skills and potentially help build your career with Salesforce!

About Salesforce
Salesforce, the Customer Success Platform and world's #1 CRM, empowers companies to connect with their customers in a whole new way. The company was founded on three disruptive ideas: a new technology model in cloud computing, a pay-as-you-go business model, and a new integrated corporate philanthropy model. These founding principles have taken our company to great heights, including being named one of Forbes’s “World’s Most Innovative Company” eight years in a row and on the FORTUNE ‘100 Best Companies to Work For®’ List twelve years in a row. We are the fastest growing of the top 10 enterprise software companies, and this level of growth equals incredible opportunities to grow a career at Salesforce. Together, with our whole Ohana (Hawaiian for ""family"") made up of our employees, customers, partners and communities, we are working to improve the state of the world.

Futureforce is Salesforce’s global university recruiting program dedicated to attracting, retaining and cultivating next generation talent.

We would have potential opportunities within the Search team :
The Search team within Salesforce seeks an outstanding Intern with a passion for software development. As a member of this team, you'll be given the opportunity to have a direct impact on the most used feature of the Salesforce platform early in your career, analyzing and optimizing features that will benefit the millions of users using Salesforce daily. This position requires you to be excited about what makes search better!

- Analyze and Optimize Solr Token Filters :
The number of tokens produced for a chunk of text is a major factor on the efficiency of the search platform: disk size, memory size, indexing speed, search speed. Simple words become one token, but punctuation, symbols, and mixed letter-number combinations ultimately yield multiple tokens. A recent analysis of our tokens showed that many appear to be of no use, thus lowering the efficiency of the platform. Over time our tokenization process has grown increasingly complex but we have not yet put effort into optimizing to a fewer number of tokens. Are you up to the task?

- Large Scale build infrastructure
Your objective, as an intern, will be to work on a proof-of-concept to consolidate the many private github repositories for the search team into a broader git monorepo, and demonstrate that maven can be replaced by bazel (build tool open-sourced by Google) while improving developer productivity (measurable). You will work with modern technologies like Bazel, Jenkins, Docker, Intellij and more. You will be able to leverage a broader company initiative that already implements that approach for other projects.

Optimize query runtime using hundred of signals
If you are interested in data structure and are curious about Solr. You will have the responsibility to find the most efficient approach to store hundreds of signals in solr that would be efficient evaluated at query time.
Build Monitoring at Scale
We are seeking an intern who is passionate about making the life of other engineers easier. We expect as a result a platform automating common monitoring tasks, to improve our capabilities of preventing, detecting and remediating anomalies at scale. The latter platform can leverage technologies such as Jupyter notebooks, Apache Airflow (workflow scheduling), Slack “chatops” bots, or Kubernetes.
Next Generation Query Suggester
You will have the opportunity to:
Understand our current query suggestion system
Develop cutting-edge Natural Language algorithms to generate more advanced suggestions
Find signals and explore new ranking methods for suggestions
Build and leverage user's query history to personalize your suggestions
Evaluate your implementation using billions of search activities from production.
Benchmark and Optimize Worm-Hashing
Your objective as an intern will be first to benchmark the existing code, comparing to multiple other Java hash map libraries open-source. Benchmarking is an area of expertise in itself. Then study the technique and implementation and potentially propose optimizations. In a second time, you will have the opportunity to implement a clean version for open-source. You will be able to study the primitive hash map usages in Lucene, to replace with Worm-Hashing, to adapt to other data structures, and to benchmark potential gains.
- Capture User Interests to drive Better Search
Your objective, as an intern, will be to help identify, build, experiment and evaluate innovative approaches for user interest profiling, recommender systems and search relevance. This challenge is a unique opportunity to have an impact on millions of customers by bringing more intelligence to search !
- Optimize query execution in text search engine
Solr/SolrCloud is a very popular and widely distributed and used integration of the Lucene search engine. The search index structure of Lucene is a set of immutable index segments. Each new indexing batch creates a new segment. Queries to the index have to query all segments separately and merge the results. There are ways to collapse multiple segments into a single (new) one to maintain the number of segments below a defined threshold.

PROGRAM :

The program is an immersive program uniquely designed for university students. You will have many opportunities to impact and learn from colleagues all over the EMEA while having fun and developing your career.
We are the most successful cloud company and your skills, dedication, and curiosity will help us continue to innovate and grow. Working at Salesforce you will have the opportunity to significantly impact how we deliver customer success.

During the program you will acquire official industry standard Salesforce certifications, and gain knowledge and invaluable international experience leading to both professional and personal development. Depending on your profile, a strong emphasis will be placed on learning skills related to the areas of technical consulting, business acumen and how to engage with customers, and through our strong coaching culture, we aim to develop you into a world-class professional, poised to grow your career anywhere at Salesforce.
PROFILE:
We consider applicants from all academic disciplines, and place great emphasis on your cultural fit with our unique Ohana, which is the Hawaiian word for ""family"", and is one of our most important values. Due to the breadth of roles in our program, at a high-level, we welcome candidates from across three main personas; technical, business, and creative.

Upfluence compte déjà plus de 60 salariés, répartis entre ses bureaux de New York, Paris, Lyon et Neuchâtel.

Qui sommes-nous :
Entre Lyon et New York, Upfluence développe des solutions technologiques pour le marketing d’influence. Nos équipes sont jeunes (28 ans de moyenne d’âge), innovantes, et internationales (18 nationalités différentes). L’équipe produit est menée par notre CTO Alexis Montagne et révolutionne l’industrie des réseaux sociaux et du marketing digital:
Du développement de programmes capables d’indexer en temps réel 5M+ de profils sur les réseaux sociaux à la création de structures complexes de données,
nous fournissons à nos 600+ clients un suivi des performances des publications et une analyse de l’audience sur les blogs et réseaux sociaux,
une identification des influenceurs en cohérence avec leur stratégie,

Nous sommes fiers des codes que nous produisons, mais ne sommes pas si catégoriques sur les méthodes et les techniques employées.
Nous croyons que créer un bon produit ne relève pas de la “bonne manière de faire”, et préférons être pragmatique et faire le nécessaire plutôt que de “suivre les règles”.
Nous avons à coeur de construire un logiciel sûr et ultra performant car nous avons conscience que nos clients en dépendent. C’est la base même de notre activité.
Ce que nous recherchons :
Vous êtes capable d’adapter et de traduire des critères commerciaux complexes en un logiciel que nos clients aimeront utiliser ;

Vous avez une expérience validée en lancement d’applications en conditions réelles et êtes attaché aux bonnes pratiques d’ingénierie informatique.
Vous êtes capable de produire des tests pertinents et comprenez l’importance d’un bon enregistrement et d’un bon monitoring des données, ainsi que du tracking des erreurs sur le long terme.
Les projets qui vous sont proposés :
Travailler de pair et appliquer au produit les résultats de l’équipe Data Science
Perfectionner notre base de données interface utilisateur en opensource qui épargnent à nos ingénieurs des heures de travail chaque semaine.
Penser “pixel-perfect” par défaut.
Ajouter de nouvelles possibilités de filtrage à notre moteur de recherches.

Des challenges techniques sérieux ;
Un PC de votre choix avec un budget de 2 000$ ;
Votre place au sein d’une équipe de développeurs de talent ;
Un spot dans un openspace moderne et agréable. Nous acceptons aussi le télétravail en fonction de vos possibilités ;
De l’autonomie et des responsabilités.
Compétences recherchées :
You êtes capable de coder en JavaScript côté client en utilisant les derniers APIs et features ;
Vous êtes familier du Golang ou êtes intéressé de l’apprendre ;
Vous avez une compréhension et une connaissance approfondie des difficultés du développement d’applications monopage ;

At Criteo, we connect 1.5 billion active shoppers with the things they need and love. Our technology takes an algorithmic approach to predict what user we show an ad to, when, and for what products. Our dataset is about 50 petabytes in Hadoop (more than 120 TB extra per day) and we take less than 10ms to respond to an ad request. This is truly big data and machine learning without the buzzwords. If scale and complexity excite you, join us.

Most of all, we are creators. From designing ground-breaking products to finding unique ways to solve technical challenges at an exceptional scale, our tech teams shape the future of advertising.
The Product Engineering team builds the products that make Criteo tick: from developing industry leading machine learning techniques, to building high scale/low latency real-time applications (over 5M QPS, handling over 300 Bn HTTP requests daily), to delivering first class client interfaces, both API and UI, with forward-thinking UX at their core, all using state of the art technology.

What You’ll Do
The goal of this 6-month internship is to develop a program that creates automatically clients for different platforms (.NET, .NET Core, Java, TypeScript, Angular...) based on the API contracts. In order to achieve this, you would need to analyze existing solutions, then choose, adapt, develop the tools/program needed to generate the clients and finally come up with a user-friendly process to automatically generate these clients and use them in the Criteo ecosystem. The stack: C#, Java, Web API, Swagger, Jenkins.
In a team of 5-7, you will be working closely with your mentor to drive your project, design and ensure best practices are applied.
You are encouraged to actively voice your ideas whilst learning how to build and ship quality code into production which will likely affect millions of users instantly.

The Product Engineering team builds the products that make Criteo tick: from developing industry leading machine learning techniques, to building high scale/low latency real-time applications (over 5M QPS, handling over 300 Bn HTTP requests daily), to delivering first class client interfaces, both API and UI, with forward-thinking UX at their core, all using state of the art technology.
What You’ll Do
The subject of your 6-month internship is to create a web application which would manage configuration for Criteo campaigns. The front-end part will require TypeScript and Angular, and the backend API is developed in .NET Core (C#), while the data access in SQL. The app will be hosted on a Linux container (Mesos and Marathon). This is a very good opportunity to create a whole application using modern stacks while becoming familiar with every layer of a web application (frontend, API, business layer, database, hosting).
In a team of 5-7, you will be working closely with your mentor to drive your project, design and ensure best practices are applied.
You are encouraged to actively voice your ideas whilst learning how to build and ship quality code into production which will likely affect millions of users instantly.
Who You Are
You are in your final year of study in Software Engineering or related field.
You have experience in developing web-based applications. You occasionally participate in coding competitions.
You are experienced in Object Oriented Programming.
You have a strong sense of ownership and a dislike for passing the buck.
You are a problem solver, a fixer, and a creative technologist. We believe coding is a talent and a passion, not just a skill.
You are a strong communicator and a team player who can work efficiently with others.
You are fluent in English."

About the job
Research and Machine Intelligence is a high impact team that’s building the next generation of intelligence and language understanding for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest techniques in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (including Deep Learning approaches like Google AI) and Natural Language Understanding. We impact products across Google including Search, Maps and Google Now.

We strive to be the best and the brightest in the fields of Research and Machine Intelligence and we’re looking for talented software engineers that have applied experience to join our team.

As a Software Engineer in Research and Machine Intelligence, you work on a small team, collaborating closely with other product teams and you’re able to switch projects as our fast-paced business grows and evolves. We need our engineers to be versatile and passionate to take on new problems. Because you’ll be working with cutting-edge technology, you’ll also get a chance to work closely with researchers across Google.
Research happens across Google everyday, in many different teams. Our research has already impacted user-facing services across Google including Search, Maps and Google Now, and is central to the success of Google Cloud and our planet-scale computing, storage, and networking infrastructure.
We do research differently here at Google. Research Scientists aren't cloistered in the lab, but instead they work closely with Software Engineers to discover, invent, and build at the largest scale. Ideas may come from internal projects, as well as from collaborations with research programs at partner universities and technical institutes all over the world. From creating experiments and prototyping implementations to designing new architectures, Research Scientists and Software Engineers work on challenges in machine perception, data mining, machine learning, and natural language understanding. You'll stay connected to your research roots as an active contributor to the wider research community by partnering with universities and publishing papers.
Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology's greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From Google Ads to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.
Responsibilities
Participate in cutting edge research to develop solutions for real-world, large-scale problems.
At Google, we don’t just accept difference—we celebrate it, we support it, and we thrive on it for the benefit of our employees, our products and our community. Google is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status. We also consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. See also Google's EEO Policy and EEO is the Law.

Our platforms
Imagine a platform hosting 1.2 millions of databases (and growing).
You have no clue of what's going on inside them, but you're responsible of keeping them up, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. You have to share resources to get very low prices, but you have to guaranty someone's behaviour won't impact their neighbour. You have to be sure customers orders will be fulfill in seconds, whatever their quantity. What about upgrading all the underlying software of such a huge play area?
Due to the law of large numbers, you'll find there the most improbable things you'll ever see.
Our team
The team consists of five people... for now. We're located in 3 locations: Roubaix, Lyon and Montréal. We're constantly using visioconf, so we're as close as if we were sat next to each others.
We believe that the service availability, the operational management, the performance, the features, the time-to-market, the innovation... all of those varied and diverse things have to be handled by the same persons. This is why we merged all of those subjects in one team (#SRE), who make the conception of the products and the platforms, and maintain them in operational conditions.
The platform is growing, and we're looking for Site Reliability Engineers to support this growth.


Your missions
Your mission, if you accept it, is to:
Automate and industrialize the management of the databases platforms. Keep them optimal, consistent and sustainable. Be proactive on the errors. Innovate and propose evolutions on the infrastructure to always match the needs.
Set alerts on the platforms health, and handle them reactively and smartly, during the day on during your on-call period. Identify and fix the root causes so that an error won't happen again.
Get the feedback of the customers, and communicate with them, using the forum, the mailing lists or via the support. If you're comfortable with that or if you want to give a try, you can also participate to meetups or write articles on the OVH blog.

What we're looking for
Know-how-to-be:
Autonomous and working hand-in-hand with the team, and the other ones
Focus on complex technical tasks and handle how plentiful context switch and interruptions from the others
Humble and communicating on the team's work
Work using short iterations and have a long term vision
Know-how:
The perfect platform is a 100% available one, with a very few human interventions, that always matches the changing needs. We need someone that know how to aim for that, using their advanced production experience and industrialization skills.
Knowledge and experience in Linux, automation, containerization...
We use Python, Perl... Some parts of the source code are recent, some parts are... legacy. it's the same for some parts of the other team's services we're using. We're looking for someone who is not afraid about this, who is adaptable, who will make a compromise between using legacy unaltered, optimize it, or rebuild it from scratch, depending on the benefit / costs balance.
When?
Sounds good? Contact us right now, the opportunity is available right now."

Signaler cette offre d'emploi",Software Engineer,Lyon,"Despite the increasing interest in machine learning (ML), many companies are finding it difficult to fully leverage its advantage because of the difficulty in setting it up effectively [Schreck, B et al., 2018]. We consider the typical stages in ML : Data Collection, Data Preparation, Modelling, Training, Evaluation, Parameter Tuning and Prediction [Yufeng Guo, 2007]. Empirical observations point out a gap in the the early stages, highlighting the urgent need of Software and Requirements Engineering research for ML [Nalchigar,S et al., 2019], [Islam, Md Johirul, et al., 2019] in order to help choosing and implementing ML solutions.
When choosing the ML strategy for a specific task, non-expert users and companies can rapidly become lost in questions such as what type of ML to use, what data is available and whether it matches the chosen type, what the right size of the dataset is, what the computation needs are, what the best model for the existing data is, what kind of performance is expected from the resulting system, among many others [Nalchigar,S et al., 2019]. Typically, such questions are answered with the help of a ML expert. We aim however to give an initial idea about such elements, automatically, by asking the user a few simple questions such as: what is the rough type of the task, how much time and other resources (people that can label data, GPUs etc) are available, as well as some simple characteristics of the available data.
Therefore, the idea of this project is to explore ways of automatically matching the constraints and requirements that a beginner would be able to describe with the typical parameters that a ML expert would use in order to asses and identify the most appropriate ML approaches for the task. The aimed expert system is not willing to help building a solution but simply to serve as an initial guide for the ML journey. It’s very important to understand the limitation of the intended system. We would consider it successful if it helps 80% of the users get basic initial guidance for their first ML projects. To put it in a different perspective, the system aims to save some days of work for people (professional and students alike) in their search for basic answers, which can have significant impact considering the great number of people and companies starting ML projects . If in addition it also saves hours of GPU usage by preventing common mistakes, the result is even more rewarding.
The project will give the successful applicant an interesting opportunity to learn about state-of-the-art machine learning methods, models and frameworks, which are highly sought-after skills in today’s job market. In addition to working on the system, the successful candidate will also contribute to a publication about the project.
Required skills
The successful candidate should be enrolled in a graduate program, at the Master or PhD level.
Good programming skills and familiarity with of one or more deep learning toolkits are required. Knowledge of methods for conceptual modeling is a plus.

Signaler cette offre d'emploi",Software Engineer,Lyon,"Altair Engineering France (AEF) is a subsidiary of Altair Engineering, Inc. ( www.altair.com ) one of the world leading editor of scientific software for engineers. With a 30-year-plus track record for product design and advanced engineering software, Altair has more than 5,000 corporate clients representing the automotive, aerospace, government and defense, and consumer products verticals.
Its software suite HyperWorks is the most widely used in the world of CAE (Computer Aided Engineering). Based on process automation, data management and design optimization, HyperWorks is a suite of simulation tools for the design and quick decision-making for product design.
Considered as the most comprehensive open-architecture simulation platform in the PLM market, offering technologies to design and optimize high performance, efficient and innovative products, HyperWorks provides the best solutions for modelling all physical problems (structural, crash&safety, thermal, fluid dynamics, electromagnetics, …). Within HyperWorks, Altair Flux simulation tool is dedicated to 2D and 3D electromagnetic analysis of low-frequency electromechanical devices and systems.
For its offices of Grenoble – Meylan (France), with the purpose of improving Flux capabilities for the computation of losses in magnetic materials, Altair opens a PhD thesis position (3-year French-CIFRE contract) in collaboration with the Grenoble Electrical Engineering laboratory (G2Elab, www.g2elab.grenoble-inp.fr ):

PhD Thesis: numerical modeling of electromechanical devices (F/M)

Context and goal of the thesis:
Altair Flux is a leading electromagnetic software based on Finite Elements and Integral Method solvers allowing designers to study innovative solutions for electric motors, transformers, sensors, actuators, induction heating systems and power electronics devices. It is the result of more than 35 years of Altair experience and of a fruitful collaboration with the G2Elab laboratory.
Recently, Flux applications related to e-mobility revolution have dramatically augmented: a key objective for the design of electric machines for e-mobility is the maximization of their efficiencies, in order to increase the autonomy of the vehicles. An accurate evaluation of the losses in the motors is then needed and is still a challenging task when it comes to the assessment of the losses occurring in their magnetic components.
Flux already features several advanced models for the computation of losses occurring in typical materials employed as magnetic circuits in rotating electrical machines. However, several improvements remain necessary to tackle the complexity of the phenomena that take place in laminated magnetic circuits: eddy currents, non-linearities, hysteresis, anisotropies, temperature effects, etc.
To increase the ability of Flux for these computations, the PhD student – under the supervision of G2Elab staff and in collaboration with Altair development teams – will be in charge of improving the existing models and the solving strategies for both laminated and solid magnetic materials. He/she will have the missions to:
study several losses modelling approaches available for 2D and 3D Finite Elements solvers, comparing in particular an a-posteriori evaluation (e.g. Bertotti and Loss Surface methodologies) and the use of a Preisach hysteresis model directly integrated to the solving process.
develop the improvements of these models to accurately take into account eddy currents that generate the so-called dynamic hysteresis phenomenon.
extend these models to consider the effect of temperature variations on material properties and consequently on iron losses.
complete the implementation in the Flux environment of these mentioned modelling strategies in order to compare their performances (accuracy, computation time, convergence, etc.) on academic cases, as well as on real industrial problems, coming from selected Altair customers.

State of the art and previous works:
This PhD thesis will benefit of the robust background of both Altair and G2Elab teams in the development of material characterization and modeling, of their knowledge on numerical formulations based on Finite Elements Method used in the solver and their solid programming environment.
In addition to this, in recent years several PhD thesis works have been carried out on the subject and represent a robust basis for this new activity. A non-exhaustive list includes:
« Contribution à la modélisation des pertes par courants de Foucault dans les circuits magnétiques feuilletés des machines électriques », Wagane Faye, 2014, Grenoble University PhD thesis.

Job description
Description
The person will be part of a multi-disciplinary team with experts in embedded software, cyber-security for the Internet-of-Things, hardware design, and machine learning.
The work will be part of the H2020 project SARMENTI (Smart multisensor embedded and secure system for soil nutrient and gaseous emission monitoring). The objective of SARMENTI is to develop and validate portable low power multisensor systems connected to the cloud to make in situ soil nutrients analysis and to provide decision support to the farmers by monitoring soil fertility in real-time. The post-doc is concerned with the application of machine learning methods to detect potential cyber-security attacks, and the development of these methods on the multisensory system.
Topic: cyber-attacks increasingly target the connected sensors&actuators employed in various domains such as agriculture. Logical attacks can be combined with physical attacks, constituting very complex attacks for which existing countermeasures are not sufficient. These devices are resource constraint and low cost, e.g., embed small processors cores, and hence cannot include strong security primitives. Supervised machine learning (ML) methods have the potential to detect abnormal behavior, resulting from such attacks, at a low cost. These methods should be embedded close to the processor core, and be easily programmed so that they can fit a given application, such as the soil monitoring.
This project aims at the investigation and demonstration of ML-based detection methods in an embedded system. The main tasks are:
Familiarise herself/himself with the embedded system platform, namely processor (e.g., RISC-V, ARM), tools, such us the compiler, linker, and simulator. Get acquainted with the state-of-the-art on the simulation of typical attacks for connected device in agriculture, e.g., physical attacks, memory attacks.
Extend the project platform with modules to trace events the execution of the core, e.g., including performance counters, register access, bus events. This trace will represent a learning base for the ML method.
Investigate a detection module in the simulator. The underlying algorithm will be based on anomaly detection, e.g., one-class classifier. This work has tree parts, implement the probes that monitor selected events, the communication infrastructure that connects the probes with the detector, and the detector itself.
Demonstrate the detection features on the SARMENTI prototype, i.e., a smart multisensor embedded system for soil monitoring, developed by European partners.
Experiment and evaluate the cost of the implementation, in terms of computing power and memory footprint, as well as its performance, in terms of false positives, false negatives, etc.
Document and present the work. We aim for publications in international workshops, conferences, and journals. Furthermore the postdoc will learn to work in a joint European project, e.g., collaborate with internat
Applicant Profile
The candidates should have a Phd and a Master degree in computer science or electronics, and should demonstrate a strong expertise in in embedded systems, , tools and programming environments, e.g., C/C++, Python, ARM development tools, and knowledge in computer architecture.
