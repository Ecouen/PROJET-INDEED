Pipeline Group is a service provider for the engineering of rigid pipelines and associated structures installation. Multiple projects are on execution and several engineers are mobilized on each of them to execute the work.

One of the methods to lay offshore pipeline is called S-Lay. The name comes from the shape taken by the catenary during installation. This method allows laying pipe at high speed (rate) but in deep-water imposes large top tension capacity to prevent from too high strain in the pipeline. To control pipeline displacement when it leaves the installation vessel, a structure, called stinger, is installed at the vessel stern. The stinger, by supporting the pipeline on a longer distance, allows to reduce the requirement of tensioning of the pipeline, and thus to install pipeline in deeper water depths.
The SEVEN BOREALIS is the SUBSEA SEVEN deep-water enabler, dedicated to rigid pipeline installation in S-lay. However, the development of new fields deeper and deeper with larger and larger pipeline diameters require a stinger upgrade to maximize the competitivity of the asset. The purpose of the internship is to design the required upgrade of the present SEVEN BOREALIS stinger, considering prospects and structural constrains of the vessel. Especially, the present improvements will be looked at:
Modifications to allow “Steep S” initiation: rigid pipeline method allowing to initiate the pipeline with/without a structure without being connected from the vessel to the initiation anchor:
connection to the anchor is performed when pipeline first end gets close to the seabed. This method is already considered for future projects,
Extension of the actual stinger length.
The trainee will be integrated within Analysis Pipeline Group department and within an engineering project team for the upgrade linked to the « Steep S » methodology.The mission implies to communicate with Pipeline Group method engineers and Offshore Resources Engineers, in charge of SUBSEA 7 asset management.
The internship will be split in several stages:
Bibliography study to understand the constrains links to stinger design (length, curvature, number of supports, number of sections…)
Study of different stinger concepts used for rigid pipeline S-laying in ultra-deepwater,
Training to rigid pipeline installation analysis with Orcaflex Software,
Set up the scope of work for the stinger upgrade to initiate in “Steep S”: characteristics of the pipeline to check, water depth, detail of the modifications to perform, validation by installation analysis on actual project cases and prospects. As this method is already considered on future projects, you will be integrated on project to properly define the required modifications to capture properly the projects constrains,
Set up the scope of work for the stinger upgrade to extend its length: characteristics of the pipeline to check, water depth, detail of the modifications to perform (lengths, sections, number of supports, curvature, type of extension, loads on the vessels and supports…). Attention shall be taken to the vessel structural constrains.
Modeling with Orcaflex installation analysis simulation with upgraded stinger,
Writing of pre-design report.
The internship report will be used internally to support decisions for future investment.

Profile:
Engineering Student in third year of engineering school cursus or equivalent with a specialization in civil or marine engineering.
The present skills are expected:
Skills and interest for engineering and Finite Element Analysis,
Beam Theory knowledge,
Flexibility,
Initiative and responsibility,
Good English level (oral and writing)
Good communication skills,
Team work.
Knowledge of Orcaflex software will be appreciated but not mandatory."

During tender and project phases, the Operations team develop an offshore schedule, describing all activities that need to be done by the vessels offshore on field to install all the different piece of equipment (pipelines, Manifold, flexible line, umbilical, …), pre-commission them and made them fully ready for hand-over to our Client.
Today, the process to setup this offshore schedule is mainly “hand driven” and required lot of People (Project Operations Manager) effort to analyse past experience and develop new schedule for new tender and project.
All analysis of variation in duration of offshore works between as-sold, as-planned and as-built are mainly done manualy with no automated tools, and no reliable and standard way of doing.
The offshore schedule is done with Microsoft Project.
The intention of this internship is to develop a tool and processes that maximize the automation process of creating offshore schedule, including understanding the Scope of Work, evaluation tasks to be performed, understanding links inter tasks and evaluate based on previous experience/evaluated time estimates, the required time to perform the tasks.
Candidate, will have access to the softwares and tools that are required to be used. He/she will also have access to previous projects schedules to understand the the work Subsea 7 is performing, how schedules are built as of today, and what type of activities and links need to be considered.
Candidate will need to prepare a standard process, develop an input interface file to summarize scope of work and potential individual activities, develop a tool to maximise offshore schedule automation for initial setup/creation, update throught out life cycle (as a minimum during tender) and variation analysis.
Depending on progress and time available, the candidate will also be required to do analysis of past projects schedule and will be required to create statistics from past projects on individual tasks, that can be used for future offshore schedule.

Following a first internship during which the anchoring system was designed for shallow depths, Subsea 7 now wants to review the anchoring systems for depths up to 6000m deep.
The trainee will be asked to review the various anchoring systems existing to date as well as the design codes allowing their industrialization.
A first selection of the anchoring system but also of the riser system will be carried out based on technical elements but also based on cost comparison between the different solutions.
The trainee will then perform a parametric technical study to assess the displacement of the platform according to the design parameters of the anchoring system (Weight, stiffness, configuration).
He/she will get in touch with the estimating department to evaluate the costs of each of the solutions and will highlight a relationship between the cost of the anchoring system and the offset of the platform.
In the same way as for the anchoring system, the design of the dynamic configuration of the power cable that connects the converter to the seabed will be evaluated for each mooring design to optimize the overall cost (cable + anchor for each configuration).
For these studies the engineer will model the converter in the Orcaflex software for which the loadings due to the winds and currents and to the swell will have been previously calculated. Orcaflex will be the software that will be used for the sizing and analysis of the anchoring system. A large number of load combinations will be studied considering the winds, currents and swells on the site.
A report will be written to present the results obtained and proposals for further studies.

Geotechnical Team forms part of the Design and Analyses group, servicing the geotechnical needs of Subsea 7 within the Global Project Centre. Our team has been involved and has extensive experience in the design and installation of foundations for a large collection of offshore developments (Oil & Gas industry and renewable industry) around the globe.
Dynamically penetrating anchors provide an extremely simple and cost-effective method of installation, by free fall from a significant distance above the seabed. In its simplest form, the so-called Torpedo piles are steel, torpedo-shaped objects that are installed as projectiles penetrating the sea floor under velocity. Used widely (more than 2000 units) by Petrobras Offshore Brazil, they are a potentially viable alternative for anchoring both mobile drilling units as well as permanent facilities.
They are designed to reach velocities of 25 to 35 m/s at the seabed, allowing tip penetrations of ~3 times the anchor length, and holding capacities after consolidation that are anticipated in the range 5 to 10 times the weight of the anchor. While such efficiencies are lower than would be obtained with other sorts of anchor, the low cost fabrication and installation compensates.
However, they have not yet been used outside of Brazilian water. There is a lack of documented installation and design methods with verification agencies.
The proposed work consists of:
Review of the design challenges for Torpedo piles on deep-water sediments.
Specific items are:
Penetration behaviour of anchors
Axial pull out capacity over the time
Lateral capacity
Establishment of design procedure
Prediction of pile embedment after free fall
Modelling of the piles with 3D finite element analyses
Validation of the numerical results by mean of published centrifuge data, model tests and field tests
Identify the further work (in terms of additional model tests in the laboratory, full-scale tests in the field and numerical modelling).
Case study: typical offshore development: Torpedo pile vs suction pile. Focus on both technical aspect and cost evaluation
Reporting
The candidate will be integrated to the offshore geotechnical team. He will work under the direct supervision of the team manager. Candidate will collaborate closely with structure department, installation group and supply chain team for other aspects of Torpedo pile viability.

Profile :

Les pieds sur le béton, les mains dans les plants, la tête dans les nuages : ça y est, il existe une solution pour des produits vraiment sains au coeur des villes. Fini les aliments qui viennent de très (très) loin, les variétés sans saveur et l’utilisation de produits pas clean pour les conserver. La quatrième Révolution Agricole sera urbaine, à deux pas de la maison !
Agricool a une mission : construire le système alimentaire de demain.
Leur solution : allier agronomie et technologie pour transformer des containers maritimes en paradis agricole au coeur des villes. A l’intérieur, ils recréent les conditions idéales de culture pour produire l’équivalent de 4000m2 de pleine terre dans 35m2, ultra-localement.
Où en sont-il ? Aujourd’hui, Agricool produit des fraises à Paris et à Dubaï, avec 0 pesticide, 90% moins d’eau et 100% d’énergies renouvelables. Demain, ils produiront une multitude d’autres cultures, partout dans le monde, même là où ça semble impossible. L’aventure Agricool a démarré en 2015 et ils sont aujourd’hui 80 à construire le système alimentaire de demain. Agricool a déjà levé 40 millions d’euros et est un des piliers européens de la #FoodTech et de l’#AgTech.

Job description
Our grandparents ate better than our parents and better than us. That’s crazy. Agricool turns this trend on its head: we’ll eat better than them all! We’re growing local, tasty and pesticide-free fruits and vegetables for everyone. For the moment, that means tasty and plump strawberries in Paris. Tomorrow, it will be a wide range of delicious fruits and vegetables everywhere on earth.
To achieve our goal, we’ve created a paradise for fruits and vegetables in recycled shipping containers. That means the best lighting, temperature, irrigation, and air quality. In just 35 m2 we can produce the same amount of food as 4000 m2 of traditional farmland. We do it with no pesticides, no transportation, and 100% renewable energy, and we sell our fruits through direct sales and supermarkets.
We started as 2 co-founders in 2015, and are now more than 75 people working everyday to shape a better food system ;-)

At Criteo, we connect 1.5 billion active shoppers with the things they need and love. Our technology takes an algorithmic approach to predict what user we show an ad to, when, and for what products. Our dataset is about 50 petabytes in Hadoop (more than 120 TB extra per day) and we take less than 10ms to respond to an ad request. This is truly big data and machine learning without the buzzwords. If scale and complexity excite you, join us.

What is it like to work in our R&D

Most of all, we are creators. From designing ground-breaking products to finding unique ways to solve technical challenges at an exceptional scale, our tech teams work with state-of-the-art methodologies to shape the future of advertising.
The Product Engineering team builds the products that make Criteo tick: from developing industry leading machine learning techniques, to building high scale/low latency real-time applications (over 5M QPS, handling over 300 Bn HTTP requests daily), to delivering first class client interfaces, both API and UI, with forward-thinking UX at their core, all using state of the art technology.
What You’ll Do
During your internship (6 months) and according to your choice, skills and interest, you can tackle one of the following subjects:

Back-end: participate to build large-scale pipelines and systems that make the best decision in a very short time, half a million times per second.
Full stack: MasterTag request production and parsing - Technical stack: a bit of TypeScript/JavaScript, C# (.Net Frmwk, .Net Core) and Mesos.
Front end: Design and implement a component in a web application that will be used to manipulate big JSON markup easily. The goal is to provide a tool to create or change layout banners in a simple and efficient way.
Data quality in the RichTimeline (Remove fraudulent users and identify low-value data) .

At Criteo, we connect 1.5 billion active shoppers with the things they need and love. Our technology takes an algorithmic approach to predict what user we show an ad to, when, and for what products. Our dataset is about 50 petabytes in Hadoop (more than 120 TB extra per day) and we take less than 10ms to respond to an ad request. This is truly big data and machine learning without the buzzwords. If scale and complexity excite you, join us.

What is it like to work in our R&D

Most of all, we are creators. From designing ground-breaking products to finding unique ways to tackle technical challenges at an extraordinary scale, our tech teams work with state of the art methodologies to shape the future of advertising.
The Site Reliability teams keep one of the largest computing platforms in the AdTech world functioning like clockwork. They are processing, storing and monitoring through large scale data compute & storage services (Hadoop, SQL & NoSQL), streaming (Kafka), platform as a service (Chef, Mesos), identity management (Kerberos) and analytics (Hive, Druid, Vertica).
What You’ll Do
You will be part of the team working on data governance and processing and you will get the full picture of data transformation: who owns it, data growth, etc. That comes together with a full exposition to our tech stack, as the data goes through many different systems: Kafka, jobs based on Hive, Spark and Presto, many different SQL and NoSQL databases for online and offline purposes.
With the guidance and support of your mentor, you will learn how to drive your project, design and ensure best practices are applied.
You will participate in all knowledge sharing sessions/ workshops.
You will gain a better understanding of how to work on real world data and mission-critical constraints.
You are encouraged to actively voice your ideas whilst learning how to build and ship quality code into production.
You will participate in architecture discussions, influence the roadmap, and take ownership.
You will work with and learn from talented engineers, with a diverse set of backgrounds.

During your internships (6 months – end of studies) and according to your choice, skills and interest, you can tackle one of the following subjects:
Streaming data catalog: You will help to deal with more than millions of messages per second, flowing from several Kafka clusters, all around the world, into one of the biggest Hadoop clusters in Europe.
Understand the data and their dependencies in Criteo based on actual usage and develop some use cases with: Scala/React/Typescript/SQL/Hadoop.
Develop tools and analyses to understand and monitor the quality of our data with Scala/React/Typescript/SQL/Hadoop.

En tant qu’iOS Senior Software Engineer tu seras en charge de contribuer à la meilleure expérience possible sur nos apps iOS, pour nos clients et nos marchants.
Avec l’ensemble de l’équipe mobile, tu contribueras à l’esprit d’équipe et à la qualité produite : par ton code, tes reviews, en apprenant et en transmettant ton savoir aux autres.
Nous avons d’énormes ambitions, c’est pourquoi une grande partie de ton travail consistera à nous aider à mettre en place de nouveaux processus pour atteindre nos objectifs plus rapidement !
Que tu sois mordu de Swift, des APIs CocoaTouch ou purement Core, tu travailleras de manière efficace et favoriseras un travail collaboratif en restant ouvert aux nouvelles idées.

iOS chez Back Market c'est :
Développer des applications Swift avec des features modulables et un Core solide : micro-frameworks, coordinators, injection de dépendances, MVVM, routing.
Des projets iOS à forte croissance sur l’App Store ou en B2B.
Tu sais également faire de la programmation événementielle via RxSwift, RxCocoa (et tu as hâte de tâter Combine).
Le back-end et les APIs n’ont pas de secrets pour toi (specs open-api, REST).
Travailler sur des outils de génération de code/resources, car écrire du code redondant n’a aucun intérêt pour toi: automation first! (SwiftGen, Sourcery).
En plus d’UIKit que tu maîtrises, coder via les frameworks Core: CoreBluetooth, CoreLocation, AVFoundation, CoreTelephony ou encore CoreMotion.
Un travail quotidien avec Git, du travail en Git-flow et des Pull Request.
La réalisation d’interfaces et d’animations in-code pour plus de vélocité et d’animations avancées (SwiftUI soon !).
Contribuer à la maintenance et l’évolution de la stack d’intégration : Bitrise, fastlane, automatisation des livraisons (Testflight, Crashlytics, Firebase App Distribution, etc.).
Avec l’aide de l’équipe Produit et Data, animer et maintenir le monitoring de l’app : KPIs, logs, crash reporting, boards.
Alimenter continuellement des échanges techniques et fonctionnels avec l’équipe Android, car c’est possible .
Adorer les “amazing” et les “woooo” lors des Keynote et sessions WWDC. Être fan de Jony Ive (avant son départ) est un gros plus !
Participer aux meetups et conférences en tant que Speaker ou spectateur (dotSwift, FrenchKit, WWDC, etc.).
Aimer les Shiba
Pour travailler avec nous tu seras :
Pédagogue et communicant, l’équipe va grandir et tes échanges avec les autres team-features sont constants.
Autonome, tu aimes porter des projets et des fonctionnalités qui vont plaire aux utilisateurs.
Team-player, tu es ouvert aux propositions et à aller plus loin sur les features (animations, quick-win qui fait la différence).
Attaché à la qualité, les tests unitaires et UI ne te font pas peur.
En recherche de collègues sympas et talentueux. Les qualités humaines sont, pour nous aussi importantes que tes compétences techniques (même si on en parle qu’à la fin ).


Pourquoi devrais-tu nous rejoindre ?

Un salaire attractif (50/70K€), des stocks (BSPCE), avantages multiples (tickets restos, mutuelle, etc...) et evenements offsite fréquents
Des challenges techniques à relever au quotidien : avec nous, tu n’auras pas le temps de t’ennuyer !
Un groupe d’experts qui t’apporteront leur savoir-faire technique et te permettront de monter en compétence sur ton domaine de prédilection mais pas que ! (Backademy, guildes techniques, Meet-up & Conference)
Des perspectives d’évolution avec la possibilité de changer de team feature tous les 1 ans et différents plans de carrières possibles (senior developer, lead dev, lead tech, engineering manager...)
Un job qui a du sens : à travers ton travail, tu convaincras des gens d’acheter des produits ayant déjà vécu au lieu de les acheter neufs. Ce qui signifie réduire la production de déchets électroniques et lutter contre la surproduction. Ça compte.
Un projet en forte croissance : on était 3 il y a 3 ans. A présent, on est plus de 200, et on a ouvert dans 6 pays différents. Ouverture prochaine d'une 20 aine de nouveaux pays en Europe. Boom.
Du groove, plein : tu auras l’opportunité de bosser avec des gens talentueux et super sympathiques.

COMPANY DESCRIPTION
SAP started in 1972 as a team of five colleagues with a desire to do something new. Together, they changed enterprise software and reinvented how business was done. Today, as a market leader in enterprise application software, we remain true to our roots. That’s why we engineer solutions to fuel innovation, foster equality and spread opportunity for our employees and customers across borders and cultures.
SAP values the entrepreneurial spirit, fostering creativity and building lasting relationships with our employees. We know that a diverse and inclusive workforce keeps us competitive and provides opportunities for all. We believe that together we can transform industries, grow economics, lift up societies and sustain our environment. Because it’s the best-run businesses that make the world run better and improve people’s lives.
Job Overview
As a member of the SAP Ariba Consulting organization, you are involved in transforming businesses through the implementation and use of the leading cloud procurement solutions of SAP Ariba.
Business Process Consulting
As a consultant on a project, you guide customers through the lifecycle of an SAP Ariba implementation. You support the blueprinting process, gather customer requirements and lead the design workshops leveraging best practices. You may also assist in the development of processes and procedures, which will leverage SAP Ariba solutions in the customer organization. You lead the final configuration of the solution and provide the customer with guidance on user acceptance testing and support in resolving issues/defects.
You have expert knowledge on SAP Ariba solutions and best practices. You leverage this knowledge to ensure that a high quality solution will be deployed that will bring value to the customer business, will be easy to use and easy to maintain. You know that you can only achieve this if you collaborate closely with the customer team and build constructive and positive relationships with all key stakeholders.
During the deployment, you provide progress information and escalate project issues to the project manager to help ensure deliverables are on time and within budget.
Project Stream Responsibility
Depending on prior experience, you can take on more responsibility on projects. This could include leading a stream, multiple streams or a complete project.
Who are you?
You enjoy working in a challenging environment where you are encouraged to take initiative. You demonstrate high energy and motivation. You have an internal drive to deliver high quality outcomes.
You are comfortable working in an international environment where you have to collaborate with people remotely.
You have strong analytical and problem solving capabilities.
You have strong interpersonal skills; you have experience in consulting and invoke trust when advising others.
You have an affinity with IT and ideally experience deploying IT solutions or acting as a super user for IT solutions. You understand the work of IT consultants and you understand the challenges and complexities that come with digitalizing business processes.
You are passionate but you maintain a rational and objective demeanor when faced with stressful or emotional situations. You express yourself clearly, using language with precision. You show an openness to people and a willingness to hear what others have to say.
You have the ability to perceive and understand the feelings and attitudes of others, the ability to place oneself “in the shoes” of another and to view a situation from their perspective.
You understand that initially you will have to absorb a great deal of new information, gain initial experience. However, once you will have overcome that hurdle you will enjoy feeling empowered to leverage your own experience and make a difference.
Most importantly, you are not perfect and maybe you do not master all these expectations but you believe in their value and want to work hard to master them.

About the job
Research and Machine Intelligence is a high impact team that’s building the next generation of intelligence and language understanding for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest techniques in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (including Deep Learning approaches like Google AI) and Natural Language Understanding. We impact products across Google including Search, Maps and Google Now.

We strive to be the best and the brightest in the fields of Research and Machine Intelligence and we’re looking for talented software engineers that have applied experience to join our team.

As a Software Engineer in Research and Machine Intelligence, you work on a small team, collaborating closely with other product teams and you’re able to switch projects as our fast-paced business grows and evolves. We need our engineers to be versatile and passionate to take on new problems. Because you’ll be working with cutting-edge technology, you’ll also get a chance to work closely with researchers across Google.
Research happens across Google everyday, in many different teams. Our research has already impacted user-facing services across Google including Search, Maps and Google Now, and is central to the success of Google Cloud and our planet-scale computing, storage, and networking infrastructure.
We do research differently here at Google. Research Scientists aren't cloistered in the lab, but instead they work closely with Software Engineers to discover, invent, and build at the largest scale. Ideas may come from internal projects, as well as from collaborations with research programs at partner universities and technical institutes all over the world. From creating experiments and prototyping implementations to designing new architectures, Research Scientists and Software Engineers work on challenges in machine perception, data mining, machine learning, and natural language understanding. You'll stay connected to your research roots as an active contributor to the wider research community by partnering with universities and publishing papers.
Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology's greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From Google Ads to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.
Responsibilities
Participate in cutting edge research to develop solutions for real-world, large-scale problems.
At Google, we don’t just accept difference—we celebrate it, we support it, and we thrive on it for the benefit of our employees, our products and our community. Google is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status. We also consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. See also Google's EEO Policy and EEO is the Law.

Within the Global Services business group, the Customer Support (CS) team aims to support all access technologies and especially the LTE and 5G new releases and features introduction in field for our main customers networks.
The main activities cover the labs testing of new features, performance assessment to anticipate any KPI degradation and the technical support of field defects.
Technical support consists in solving complex network problems by developing know-how and expertise that is useful when introducing new features or products to the customer network.
The assistance provided to field teams on the one hand and exchanges with R&D teams on the other hand make it possible to investigate software anomalies by using the specifications to find corrective measures. In addition, we are involved in the preparation, documentation and execution of functional tests on new functionalities with our own equipment (labs), identical to the solutions deployed by operators.

Description:
Telecom laboratory platforms (labs) are installations that can change over time, while maintaining consistency with the environment (IP connection, access to servers in Finland, configuration of a client that must remain stable...). These rapid changes can sometimes lead to problems such as misinterpretations of results when they are not known in real time or managed methodically and documented in a database.
The need here is to manage these platforms with a database and a graphical visualization and change management tool, useful and necessary for management to manage the priorities of the problems and tasks of everyone in the team. Creating this tool requires computer knowledge, coding (PHP, JS, API on Nokia tools) and also some telecom knowledge to understand the configuration of platforms, the process and existing working methods and finally the expectations of users for their daily work.
In addition, depending on the progress of the tool and the needs, it will be possible to learn about customer support engineer activities.

Under the responsibility of your tutor, you will have to:
Participate in the development of the specifications and specifications of the tool
Define a development and test plan for the selected solution
Document and train users

At the end of this internship, you will have the benefit of a rich experience in IT and telecoms, in an international and multicultural environment, with a practical application of your theoretical knowledge and responsibility.

Qualifications :
Master level intership
Good practice of some languages such as PHP , Javascript , APIs/macro, Excel (for data extraction) , databases (SQL , Apache , Redis )
SW design environment : IP, Linux, Apache
Telecoms : Radio access learnings (2G/3G, LTE, 5G)
Fluent in French and English

Autonomous, open minded and able to work in multicultural team environment
Accountable and communicate easily
Serious and well organized

What does NOKIA offer you?
Interaction with international teams of system architects, software, project managers, testers, integrators
Visibility on the latest configuration control technologies, innovative mobile networks SRAN, 5G, Cloud

BlaBlaCar’s vision is to bring fairness, freedom and fraternity to the world of travel. BlaBlaCar was created in 2006 with one dream in mind: fill the millions of empty seats on the road to create an efficient, affordable and friendly way to travel. Today, our global, trusted community counts 75 million members in 22 countries, enabling a smarter, large scale and truly sustainable transport network.
Born from a simple idea of people sharing their rides, BlaBlaCar’s ambition is to become the go-to marketplace for shared road mobility. We offer long distance carpooling service, a commuting carpooling service, and since 2018 a marketplace bus service too. A filled bus emits one third of the emissions per passenger kilometer as an average car. So we want to fill those seats too!
In 2018, 84 million travellers used BlaBlaCar globally saving 1.6 million tons of CO2. Meanwhile we enabled human connections, bringing people closer together in more ways than one with 87% of members say that carpooling is an enriching experience.
BlaBlaCar offers a truly and unique international environment with a team counting 35 nationalities, serving a global member-base from 8 offices in Berlin, Kiev, Madrid, Milan, Moscow, Paris (HQ), São Paulo, Warsaw. English is the official spoken language across BlaBlaCar. We are privately-held and founder-led. Our team of 500 employees is entrepreneurial, passionate, and fundamentally mission-driven.

You’ll provide decision support through research, analysis of information, and clear presentation of considerations.
3/ Key contribution to Tech Executive Communications
You’ll prepare memos, presentations, and emails for internal and external audiences. This involves setting the agenda for engineering all-hands meetings, internal keynotes, helping draft presentations to the executive team and board.
You stay up-to-date with the Tech economy and community and leverage your knowledge in a Blablacar context to sustain our Tech ambitions.
In the situations where the VP Engineering has multiple commitments, you’ll provide counsel on how to collaborate to ensure coverage.

Nokia Bell Labs’ AAAID research domain focuses on the blending of intelligence into all aspects of everyday life and processes. As devices and sensors become increasingly connected and several autonomous agents with a physical presence make an appearance in smart homes and factories, the need for intelligent algorithms to support machines within complex physical spaces shared with humans becomes a primary driver of our research. The Future X network will be the platform that dynamically provides the knowledge and the computing power to support machine interactions at scale. Our ambitious objective is to develop systems that collect and blend information from multiple sources, extract and make sense of the things that matter, and act upon and propagate the resulting knowledge. Our research targets the fields of industrial automation and smart cities.

Scope of the Ph.D. Thesis

Future industrial automation scenarios will be defined by the coexistence of heterogenous devices that include sensors, mixed-reality displays, robots, drones, and smart objects. The development of new functionalities involving these mobile devices will face fundamental limitations, imposed by the resource constraints inherent to the devices’ form factor and by the technical possibilities of wireless connectivity. While accelerators for compute-intensive tasks will help empower the devices with local “intelligence” for solving specific tasks, the evolution of ever-smaller goal-driven machine designs will still limit the complexity of generalized problem-solving capabilities and require distributed coordination of sensing and processing among devices and infrastructure. Other constraints - such as battery life, thermal dissipation, interactivity, expected quality and timeliness of the decisions - provide a large spectrum of trade-offs in the design of algorithms that manage real-time, computational-intensive functions that underpin sensor coordination and machine learning in augmented reality and robotics.

Research Topic

The Ph.D. thesis will focus on developing techniques aimed at augmenting autonomous machines capabilities through accelerated processing, by overcoming their inherent computing limitations while still meeting different requirements including scalability, latency, and energy efficiency.

The student will explore challenging use cases that highlight how industrial automation scenarios might benefit from an infrastructure tailored towards integrating sharing of knowledge across different types of machines. In particular, he/she will focus on the mobile devices that will populate the factory ecosystem (e.g. drones, robots). These machines will be required to take over tasks that require dynamic cooperative interaction with the environment. Towards this goal, these machines will need to gather contextual information and act in real time. The end goal of the Ph.D. will be designing and developing algorithms and systems that integrate into the envisioned industrial automation environment.

Two key research questions will be tackled in the context of the Ph.D. program:
The architecture of the computing environment is expected to play a key role in supporting information exchange among machines, as the presence of distributed resources drives down the complexity of these devices and supports their interactions by offloading computing tasks that would have to be otherwise executed on every device. The thesis will explore how systems could use the infrastructure to gather and merge information into exploitable knowledge.
Supporting the generation of contextual awareness through information exchange will require collecting and processing data from a large number of sensors at low latency, without impacting their inherent power restrictions. The advancements in wireless access technologies plays an important role in supporting industrial IoT scenarios, but also requires a fundamental re-thinking of how data will be delivered, processed, and aggregated on the way. More powerful delivery paradigms could be explored exploiting context-based communication and control schemes.

Job Grade/Level: 6

We are looking for a highly-motivated candidate who is enthusiastic about developing breakthrough innovations and participate in cutting-edge research in NOKIA Bell Labs.

A BAC+5 diploma or master's degree in communications, computer science or electrical engineering with focus on embedded systems, as well as a good knowledge in communication networks and programming languages for systems development (e.g. C++, C, python). Most importantly, the applicant should be willing and able to get engaged in novel and disruptive research areas across multiple disciplines, which will require the applicant to readily learn new skills and expand their toolbox.

A propos du centre ou de la direction fonctionnelle
Located at the heart of the main national research and higher education cluster, member of the Université Paris Saclay, a major actor in the French Investments for the Future Programme (Idex, LabEx, IRT, Equipex) and partner of the main establishments present on the plateau, the centre is particularly active in three major areas: data and knowledge; safety, security and reliability; modelling, simulation and optimisation (with priority given to energy).
The 450 researchers and engineers from Inria and its partners who work in the research centre's 28 teams, the 60 research support staff members, the high-level equipment at their disposal (image walls, high-performance computing clusters, sensor networks), and the privileged relationships with prestigious industrial partners, all make Inria Saclay Île-de-France a key research centre in the local landscape and one that is oriented towards Europe and the world.
Contexte et atouts du poste
The postdoc will be held at Inria Saclay - Ile-de-France in the Gamma team-project under the supervision of Frederic Alauzet.

The work will be done in collaboration with Boeing and Safran Tech that are users of the mesh adaptation technology.
Mission confiée
The aim of mesh adaptation is to generate the best mesh to perform a specific numerical simulation. It results in a powerful methodology that reduces significantly the size of the mesh required to reach the desired accuracy. Thus, it impacts favorably the simulation CPU time and memory requirement. Moreover, as the generated adapted mesh is in agreement with the physics of the flow, for some applications, this is the only way to obtain an accurate prediction of the flow.
Nowadays, mesh adaptation is a mature tool which is well-posed mathematically. And, as it is fully automatic, it has started to be used in industrial R&D departments. Indeed, it has already proved, throughout many publications and applications, its superiority with respect to fixed mesh. However, simulating complex physical phenomena on complex 3D geometries (such as high-lift applications or turbomachinery applications), which is more and more required by industry, still remains a challenge. Indeed, high-fidelity prediction for such numerical simulations requires large size meshes (hundreds of million elements) even if anisotropic mesh adaptation is considered.
A quicker response of the adaptative process requires a parallelization of the full platform, i.e., the parallelization of the flow solver, the error estimate, the local remesher and the interpolation stage. This also requires a proper mesh partitioning which is optimal for each stage of the mesh adaptation loop.
A first step in this direction has been done with the shared-memory parallelization of the whole solution-adaptive simulation platform using a shared-memory parallelization library developed in the team: the LPlib. An overall (real time) strong speed-up between 10 and 15 on twenty cores is usually achieved on industrial applications.
A second step has been achieved with the distributed-memory parallelization of the local remesher and the development of an efficient mesh partitioning which takes into account the remesher work load. With this strategy, we were able to generate, for a model problem, a billion elements in 15 minutes on 100 processors. But, this has been done outside of the solution-adaptive platform.
The goal of this Post Doctoral position is to finalize the distributed-memory parallelization of each stage of the mesh adaptation loop and to design optimal transition between each stage as mesh repartitioning will be required to obtain balance work load at each step.

The postdoc will first learn all the concepts related to mesh adaptation. He/she will perform several 3D adaptive simulations of inviscid and viscous flows to become familiar with the Inria solution-adaptive simulation platform involving a flow solver, an adaptive mesh generator, an error estimate code and an interpolation code.
Once familiar with the mesh adaptation platform, the postdoc will work on the parallelization with MPI of the flow solver, the error estimate and the solution interpolation software. For each tool, we will analyze in detail the obtained strong speed-up and will set-up the optimal hybrid parallelization using shared-memory and distributed memory techniques. We will also enhance the mesh partitioning code to obtain an optimal load balancing and to output appropriate partitions (ghost cells, ...) for each tool.
The next step will be to link all the tools involved in the solution-adaptive simulation platform and to analyse deeply the obtained strong speed-up. This may lead to work on the development of parallel IO's in the LibMesh library.

The developed methodology will be validated on several industrial problems in aeronautics and turbomachinery and will be
run on Inria Saclay Ile-de-France cluster composed of 1000 processors. In aeronautics, in collaboration with Boeing, we will focus of drag and high-lift prediction applications. In turbomachinery, in collaboration with Safran, we will focus on compressor and stator simulations.
As one can see, in this work, the postdoc will be confronted to advanced scientific computing issues (numerical schemes, fast and efficient implementation of the numerical methods, parallel computing,...).

About CoFi OS
-------------

CoFi OS is a technology stack developed by ConsenSys, partly open sourced, and compatible with all projects related to financial assets. CoFi OS enables the issuance, management and transfer of ""tokenized"" financial assets in a completely secure way, and in compliance with regulations in an automated manner.

CoFi OS was designed to be compliant with financial market requirements, including the European market. It proves to be a particularly relevant technology for the ""tokenization"" of non-listed shares, specifically the shares of Venture Capital funds, Private Equity funds, or the shares of real estate investment companies.

The ""tokenization"" of financial assets delivers important benefits for investors and issuers:

Operational efficiency: simplification and reduction of costs related to the issuance, management and transfer of assets.
Market expansion: broaden potential investor base through a simpler acquisition process and lower minimum entry tickets.
Additional features: opening/simplification of a secondary market, and easier transmission of information between issuers and investors.
Interoperability is a major challenge in the context of ""tokenization,"" as only a solution for issuing generic financial assets that is compatible with a maximum number of blockchain platforms can facilitate adoption.

The interoperability of CoFi OS is based on:
An open-source standard specifically designed for financial assets (ERC1400), shared and reviewed by the Ethereum community, and backward compatible with the most widely used standard (ERC20).
Combination of Ethereum private networks (to meet the challenges of scalability, privacy, and finality of transactions) and the public network (for interoperability) with the ability to transfer securities from one network to another in a secure manner.
Using Ethereum blockchain technology, that today has the largest developer community in the world (+400K).

JOB
Talentsoft développe une solution web de gestion des Talents : notre outil est une suite de modules en mode SaaS qui assiste les équipes Ressources Humaines dans la gestion du recrutement, de la formation et de la gestion des carrières. Notre solution permet à 10 millions d’utilisateurs d’avoir un impact sur leur trajectoire professionnelle : avec Talentsoft, demander une mobilité, candidater sur un poste ouvert, se former en ligne ou bien piloter les rémunérations de son équipe se fait en quelques clics.

Pour concevoir, développer et faire évoluer cette solution, 200 ingénieurs travaillent chez Talentsoft ; chaque jour, ils améliorent les modules existants, et enrichissent la solution en développant les fonctionnalités qui permettront aux clients de mieux gérer leurs processus RH.

Les équipes techniques sont principalement composées de Développeurs qui développent en C#, .NET, ASP.NET. Certains sont passionnés par l’algorithmie, d’autres se forment petit à petit aux technologies Frontend.

Actuellement, nous remplaçons des pans entiers de l’application par des composants ReactJS (démarche DesignSystem). Nous utilisons SQL Server pour les bases de données et la solution est hébergée sur Azure. Les squads fonctionnent toutes en Agile (SCRUM ou Kanban), et on essaye tous d’appliquer les principes DevOps pour délivrer en continu.

Une journée-type dans la vie d’un Développeur chez Talentsoft :

De bon matin, tu participes au Stand-Up Meeting,
Avec ta squad, vous vous fixez des objectifs réalistes pour la journée,
Au cours de la journée, tu passes du temps sur ton clavier : tu développes de nouvelles features, tu améliores une fonctionnalité existante ou bien tu refactores du code. Tu travailles en solo, ou bien avec ton « Peer »,
Quand tu n’es pas sur ton clavier, alors tu échanges avec les membres de ta squad : un Product Owner, mais aussi un UX Designer, un Architecte et un Quality Engineer. Ensemble vous trouvez de nouvelles façons d’avancer dans la même direction,
Jour après jour, tu échanges avec les membres de ta guilde, qui travaillent sur d’autres parties de l’application, dans d’autres squads. Ainsi, tu apprends de nouvelles choses, chaque jour.
PROFILE

Quelques exemples de projets en cours :
Nous remplaçons une partie de notre applicatif par des composants ReactJS, et nous modernisons la stack en remplaçant les Webforms par des technologies plus modernes,
Nous enrichissons notre SDK afin que des éditeurs tiers puissent créer des widgets directement à l’intérieur de notre applicatif, et nous créons une plateforme PaaS,
Nous développons notre nouveau CoreHR, le cœur de l’application regroupant toutes les données administratives des collaborateurs,
Nous développons un module d’évaluation en continue des collaborateurs qui ressemble beaucoup à un board Trello,
Nous développons notre première appli mobile (Android et iOS) pour rendre les Systèmes d’Information RH plus accessibles à tous les utilisateurs,
En somme, chez Talentsoft, nous enrichissons chaque jour notre produit, et nous travaillons régulièrement sur de nouveaux projets qui viennent enrichir l’applicatif existant – le tout, dans une démarche DevOps / CI, en automatisant le plus possible les tests et les phases de release.

Ce qu’il te faut pour réussir dans ce poste :
Tu as au moins 10 ans d'expérience en développement web ;
Si tu maîtrises C# .NET, tout sera plus simple pour toi,
Chez Talentsoft, nous sommes d’éternels apprenants : on aime tester, construire, déconstruire, échouer, apprendre, recommencer, réussir.
Chez Talentsoft, on aime expérimenter. C’est ta curiosité et ta soif d’apprendre qui te permettront de te sentir bien dans ton poste, et de te trouver de nouvelles limites,
Très sincèrement, c’est tout ce qu’il te faut.

Quelques infos en plus :
Tu auras un ordinateur puissant, et 2 à 3 écrans (24 pouces),
Tu travailles dans un open space calme et propice à la concentration, entouré(e) de ta squad,
Tu bénéficies de 20% de freetime pour explorer de nouveaux projets,
Tu iras dans des confs : Devoxx, Meilleur Dev de France, Dev Fest, Api Days…
Tous les vendredis, on organise un meetup interne avec des pizza pour présenter un sujet tech (nouvelle techno, nouvel outil…),
On est favorable au télétravail (1 jour par semaine),
On a une bonne mutuelle et un bon CE, on rembourse 50% des titres de transport, 50% des tickets resto.
Si tu veux un aperçu des projets techniques que l’on met en œuvre chez Talentsoft, tu peux lire le blog des Développeurs. Si tu veux rencontrer nos équipes et travailler avec nous, envoie-nous ton CV !

ConsenSys is a venture production studio and the leading global blockchain technology firm. Our mission is to transform the emerging economic, social, and political operating systems of the planet by building and scaling applications, disruptive startups, and enterprise software products empowered by decentralized technology, specifically Ethereum.

About CoFi OS

CoFi OS is a technology stack developed by ConsenSys, partly open sourced, and compatible with all projects related to financial assets. CoFi OS enables the issuance, management and transfer of ""tokenized"" financial assets in a completely secure way, and in compliance with regulations in an automated manner. CoFi OS was designed to be compliant with financial market requirements, including the European market. It proves to be a particularly relevant technology for the ""tokenization"" of non-listed shares, specifically the shares of Venture Capital funds, Private Equity funds, or the shares of real estate investment companies.

The ""tokenization"" of financial assets delivers important benefits for investors and issuers:

Operational efficiency: simplification and reduction of costs related to the issuance, management and transfer of assets.
Market expansion: broaden potential investor base through a simpler acquisition process and lower minimum entry tickets.
Additional features: opening/simplification of a secondary market, and easier transmission of information between issuers and investors.
Interoperability is a major challenge in the context of ""tokenization,"" as only a solution for issuing generic financial assets that is compatible with a maximum number of blockchain platforms can facilitate adoption.

The interoperability of CoFi OS is based on:
An open-source standard specifically designed for financial assets (ERC1400), shared and reviewed by the Ethereum community, and backward compatible with the most widely used standard (ERC20).
Combination of Ethereum private networks (to meet the challenges of scalability, privacy, and finality of transactions) and the public network (for interoperability) with the ability to transfer securities from one network to another in a secure manner.
Using Ethereum blockchain technology, that today has the largest developer community in the world (+400K).

A dynamic startup environment. ConsenSys is a thought leader in the blockchain space and we are absorbing a significant portion of the mindshare. This is both exciting and challenging, as we learn to scale our organization while adhering to the principles of decentralization
Deep technical challenges. This entire ecosystem is less than 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler.

ConsenSys was named a Top 100 FinTech company by KPMG's 2016 Fintech Innovators report

The platform we develop uses both virtual and bare-metal systems spanning over 50 data centers in 15 different regions serving millions of users from every corner of the globe.

Evaluate performance of current and future systems, both software and hardware
Participate in design of new systems
Develop and maintain the automation framework used for all systems
Participate in on-call rotation to ensure fast response to production issues

A typical morning for Sergio looks like : ""We have one sync meeting per week for our squad, where we know what each member of the team is working on or we comment the issues of the last on-call. The rest of the day I organize to work on the projects I'm involved""

Knowledge of Shell scripting and at least one scripting language (Python, Ruby, etc.)

About CoFi OS
-------------

CoFi OS is a technology stack developed by ConsenSys, partly open sourced, and compatible with all projects related to financial assets. CoFi OS enables the issuance, management and transfer of ""tokenized"" financial assets in a completely secure way, and in compliance with regulations in an automated manner.

CoFi OS was designed to be compliant with financial market requirements, including the European market. It proves to be a particularly relevant technology for the ""tokenization"" of non-listed shares, specifically the shares of Venture Capital funds, Private Equity funds, or the shares of real estate investment companies.

The ""tokenization"" of financial assets delivers important benefits for investors and issuers:

Operational efficiency: simplification and reduction of costs related to the issuance, management and transfer of assets.
Market expansion: broaden potential investor base through a simpler acquisition process and lower minimum entry tickets.
Additional features: opening/simplification of a secondary market, and easier transmission of information between issuers and investors.
Interoperability is a major challenge in the context of ""tokenization,"" as only a solution for issuing generic financial assets that is compatible with a maximum number of blockchain platforms can facilitate adoption.

The interoperability of CoFi OS is based on:
An open-source standard specifically designed for financial assets (ERC1400), shared and reviewed by the Ethereum community, and backward compatible with the most widely used standard (ERC20).
Combination of Ethereum private networks (to meet the challenges of scalability, privacy, and finality of transactions) and the public network (for interoperability) with the ability to transfer securities from one network to another in a secure manner.
Using Ethereum blockchain technology, that today has the largest developer community in the world (+400K).

To do so, we rely on cutting-edge AI modelling and heavy cloud-computing, leveraging the most recent technology.
You may know pretty well how to build complex models using state of the art machine learning techniques. However, when it comes to describe a complex phenomenon with a simple and interpretable model, you may have no other ideas than to ‘hack’ a Gradient Boosting or a Multi Layered Perceptron. With researchers from ENS-INRIA we built the fundamentals of an optimization technique that is interpretable by design. We bring non-linear penalized regressions to the next level using state of the art optimization advances: if you're curious about the subject, you can take a look at our collaboration paper with a Google AI researcher.
As a data scientist, you will contribute to the design of machine-learning models to enhance risk modelling, demand modelling (probability of potential clients to buy our products or renew their contracts) and price optimization (determine best price to sell the insurance product).
Practically you will begin by... :
Reading, understanding and explaining to the team strengths and weaknesses of research papers in ML, algorithmic and optimization
Implement pragmatic solutions and test their robustness on our data
Optimize your code using Cython, to achieve the same performance of open-source packages such as Numpy or Scikit-learn.
... and integrate your findings in production:
Implement reliable tests, use continuous integration and exploit at best AWS Cloud capabilities with our back-end engineers.
Your work will:
Rely on a strong understanding of the machine learning methods and optimization techniques used (R&D papers)
Take into account the business objectives of the models created (in particular: robustness, interpretability and implementation cost).
Design, build, integrate and maintain efficient, reusable and reliable code.
Requirements
High proficiency in mathematics (in particular statistics), algorithmic (optimization), and programming.
Knowledge in machine learning, signal processing, speech recognition or image processing.
Interest in R&D topics
Strong problem solving skills: high level of rigor, integrity, curiosity and self-motivation.
Communication and presentation skills.
Excited about code craftsmanship, to build robust code with the best practices.
Comfortable with Python (NumPy, Pandas, ...) and knowledge of an object-oriented language (Java, C#...)
Bonus:
Experience with Scikit-Learn API and its coding standards.
Experience with Docker, Terraform is a plus.
Benefits
You'll join a motivate team, willing to share their knowledge and passion for advanced computer science and software development."

URGENT INTERVIEW NOW
A really exciting opportunity for a solid Datacenter Technical Engineer to work closely with Partners, Engineers & customer Stakeholder on Engagements for the Data Centre or Infrastructure Project build needs. You will use your technical experience as an Infrastructure Engineer to understand the customer’s Rack capacity, network and storage systems needs and pain points. Working in a small EMEA Team of Engineers with the IT Partners you will help on-site in the Data Centre required or the Network/Data Infrastructure needed to support their business critical requirements and deliver a “right first time” support in the Data Centre or IaaS experience. You will join this expanding Global Solution Provider, oversee & build DC Racks & Stacks with TCP/IP connectivity to configure Networking and Systems, set up Routers & Switches for their Computing Application needs across all vertical markets, Retail, eTail, Finance etc. as required.
This is a very “hands on” Technical Engineer position as a “Jack of all Trades” where you will identify, and deliver with Partners on Design Plans using Cisco Networks, EMC, DELL Servers and Storage, Security, DCIM, Power needs & cooling for Energy efficiencies for the Data Centre etc. You will work with Global Engineering Team to provide the delivery from the wide Portfolio of Products for the right solution for various networks software with LinuX, Windows or iOS or new IT systems or storage, high availability and 24/7 cover etc. as needed in various industry requirements needs etc. You will work with the Project Team & Regional Engineer & other Technical and Subject Matter Experts to understand customer requirements and deliver on-site for Projects required for various stages of the design and build plan, to meet expectations and realistic timescales. You will need English and French or German, as your local language, as required on Technical needs. As you will be supporting the European Regions too, these will be in English as the 1st Global language. All Training will be conducted in English too, therefore fluent English is a must.
This is a challenging opportunity and you may be working with some Legacy systems to transfer to faster networking, virtualisation or Optimisation to SaaS Projects. Migration, needs from the existing systems design needs for a new Data Centre or Co-location etc. and Systems which could be within various heavily regulated domains covering eTail, Retail, Financial, Energy, Banking, Insurance, Government & Utilities etc. Commissioning & decommissioning experience would be good to have.
Responsibilities will be varied and include:
Using your strong technical “hands on” delivery background in DC build, cabling, Fibre Channel etc. networking and storage needs for IaaS and on-site Data Centre planning needs.
You will be responsible for helping with the engineering life cycle, the delivery of the Data Centre or IaaS or PaaS etc Project to be rolled out. Good Electricity & Power experience, DR etc.
Continuously update technical knowledge and learn new products in Data Centre design and build such as Schneider Struxtureware, Emerson, Multipower UPS, APC, Energy & Cooling etc. Networking and Storage for service offerings and support.
Continuously maintain awareness of competitor offerings, strengths and weaknesses.
When up & running, you can progress to:
Working with the Stakeholders and team on the “As is & To be” model required and needs with the customer stakeholders or Partner Consultants and ensure that the design & Project Plan and timescales for the full life cycle are shared with the Engineers, Customer & Partners to agree on the needs and statement of works SOW to be delivered with the timescales and planned delivery, and potential issues, etc.
Projects initially will be cross vertical & you will help with small & larger Data Centre delivery across Cisco & integration needs.
Below is the wish list – as you will need to enjoy learning new skills and technologies as you cannot have them all:
An example could be - You will help with the plans to migrate data from old IT Infrastructure to new integrated systems to and this could be moving from on-premise to a new IaaS or Data Centre with DR and Co-location for expansion in Storage and faster network needs. This could include Unified Comms to deliver enhancements for Data Networks, LAN, WAN, Voice & Video, multiple devices, POS, laptops, virtual, remote working & integrate to secure networks & Cisco infrastructure. Hence you will be a “trusted Engineer” in a “hands on” role to deliver to the customer needs and provide confidence and a positive “can do” approach. You will add value and carry out trouble shooting on the Operating systems etc. Linux, Unix etc. as needed to provide best practice solutions. Knowledge and experience of Cisco Networking builds, switches, routers, Cisco Unified Comms, UCCX would be great etc. A lapsed CCNA or similar with IaaS and Virtualisation, Hyper V or VMWare based Apps would be advantageous, not essential.
You will work with Best Practice and understand regulatory Power & Energy issues for the customer journey, working with them on site, helping to make their daily IT systems easier to manage and ensure customer satisfaction etc.
Ideal Profile:
An experienced Datacenter Technical Engineer with full lifecycle over 3-5 years experience, used to working in a small regional team.
Used to delivering on some of the above needs together with:
Raise Issues, create break & fix issues and present to the Stakeholders with timescales and plan of delivery.
Passionate about a “right first time” Customer Support Journey experience & Best Practice.
Good capacity planning – lapsed CCNA or similar for networking and poss. low latency and connectivity needs etc. TCP/IP, Rack & Stack, Servers etc.
Good Technical and responding to issues and other Technical support & knowledge of Enterprise Architecture Systems and any knowledge of rack space, decommissioning and working on Co-location projects.
Degree. BSc. IT, Software, Systems or relevant experience in Enterprise, for larger systems for 24/7 transactions. Professional who enjoys delivering Data Center needs in a customer facing role with travel across your region & EMEA.
An exciting progressive career awaits you with a friendly & fun, passionate Company Team Spirit.

Are you ready to make an impact at a ground-breaking tech company, powered by the world’s largest online travel platform?
We are rewriting the book on how companies and their employees arrange travel. Unique in the market, we operate like an agile and entrepreneurial start-up but are backed by one of the world’s largest travel groups Expedia Group. Expedia Group has invested twice the amount on technology advancement in the last year than any of Egencia’s competitors and this means we’re growing and growing fast.
We are seeking a Senior Engineer to assist Egencia's Infrastructure and Platform team. You'll work with your core team to develop, test, and implement concepts that will improve Egencia's stack at-large, but you'll also get to know as much of the organization as possible from Technology to Marketing - and all points in between - to help realize a collective vision for the company.
What you’ll do
Be empathetic. You're expected to mentor others. Sometimes they'll be junior engineers. Sometimes they'll be your peers. Sometimes they'll be your managers. Sometimes you'll require a mentor. Someone who can ask intelligent questions across all skill levels is a great engineer. Someone who can do so while simultaneously realizing others have different priorities and abilities is an excellent engineer.
Be curious. Learn as much about the entire stack as you can. Sometimes that knowledge will be a brief introduction at a high level architectural level. Sometimes it'll be a request to learn a legacy system in a short time span in order to assist another team with an important deadline.
Merge the green fields with their legacies. You may need to scrap a component and write it anew. You may need to write a tool to work around a legacy issue. You may need to refactor mercilessly. And, sometimes, you may just have to stare at a problem and decide to do nothing.
Don't be afraid of programming languages. You probably have your favourite language. You may even have your least favourite language. Maybe they're both used within our stack. Understand why that's the case and be comfortable with the fact that programming languages are simply tools used for problem solving.
Get involved in as many initiatives within the company as possible. Just remember, other people are interested in those initiatives as well, so document your travels well.
Work to eliminate the term DevOps in favour of the term Engineering. Sometimes you'll do development, but that's not helpful if your code can't survive in the wild world of production. Sometimes you'll get involved in operations, but that's not helpful if your work isn't able to be maintained by yourself or others.
Work to create the best possible solution. Sometimes you'll need to make the smallest possible change to improve the system in one area. Sometimes, you'll have to think through a large number of contingencies to make improvements in a different part of the system. Use your industry experience to do so and help others understand your decision. Let others do the same for you.
Who you are
Bachelor's Degree (or equivalent experience) in Computer Science, Engineering, Information Technology, or a related field.
Strong communication skills. You're on a team that's responsible for dealing with a lot of moving parts. You should be able to communicate to others how those parts connect and make sure your own understanding is clear.
A strong empathetic nature...
...and the ability to express your opinion in a respectful manner.
The ability to think of yourself as a Software Detective without smirking too much internally at the term.
Experience in an Agile environment.
A strong knowledge of distributed systems as well as the realization that you probably don't know as much as you think you do.
The ability to strike a balance between analytical and creative thinking.
The ability to take minimal starting input and turn it into an actionable plan.
Deep knowledge of Linux and all of its associated components is desirable. You may not be an authority, but you should feel comfortable diving in with little guidance if someone asks you to, say, investigate a subnet problem.
Exposure to AWS is a plus.
Exposure to Java technologies is a plus...
...as is a deep understanding of the JVM.
Travel industry experience is a plus.
Why join us
Expedia Group recognizes our success is dependent on the success of our people. We are the world's travel platform, made up of the most knowledgeable, passionate, and creative people in our business.

So, the bar’s set high, because our customer’s demand the best. This is why we want you…Of course, you’re a technology expert, but we work very closely with our customers, so you’re a great communicator, too, with an ability to see both the widescreen and the close-up. And when we say communicate, we mean you’ll be talking with everyone from the DBA to the C Suite; comfortable and confident that you’ll deliver the best possible solutions for your customer. So, you’ll have a great deal of responsibility, but you’ll also have autonomy to make your own decisions, and what you’ll learn and gain in experience just isn’t found anywhere else.Which is also true of Teradata Vantage software; we call it pervasive data intelligence, because it transforms data into answers, into real solutions for our customers.

We don’t expect you to be an expert in everything; in fact, we’d prefer you to have wide and far reaching knowledge and experience, with perhaps a specialism field or two that you are expert in. And whatever your particular experience, you can explain, demonstrate and deliver right across the board in your customer’s organisation.And, though ‘passion’s’ a little over-used these days, we mean it when we say we’ll recognise, develop and transform your passion for your customer’s success into your own personal success. So, if your passion for real, deliverable solutions to some of the biggest data challenges in the world matches ours, and what we’ve said appeals to your sense of adventure, come and work for us.What you’ll be doing: What we’d like you to be: And, if possibleTeradata is firmly committed to diversity and equal opportunity in all aspects of our business.

Role description
Background:
Several billion people have no Internet access today and drone or satellite communication could be a game changer for them; for instance, Google and FaceBook (among others) are investigating low altitude drone or balloon-based Internet relays, but coverage area is limited (metro, region). Also, satellite communication already exists for larger areas but uses radio frequencies and are limited to low data rates.
Nokia Bell Labs is investigating a third option: high speed optical communication between ground and satellites.
The data rate of such communication heavily depends on the properties of the channel between the ground station and the satellites. As an Ph.D. student, you will be asked to work on the modeling of the atmospheric channel in the context of high speed satellite communications. This work line covers software development as well as hardware, where an atmospheric emulation testbed is to be implemented to support the studies on the channel characteristics and all subsequent research and validation activities.
Duration: 3 years.
Your role:
Develop an atmospheric channel model
Set up experimental testbed in our lab to emulate the atmospheric channel and modern optical communication (with coherent modulation) signals.
Run lab experiments to assess the limiting conditions of this channel on modern optical communication signals, for instance, assess the maximum data rate achievable for various modulations, conditions of the channels, position of the satellite, etc. The signal decoding software suite (DSP) will be provided by our lab.
Develop the channel simulation tool (program) for satellite communication (ground to satellite, and satellite to ground) to support the development of the high-speed communication chain and validate the experimental results.
Working towards an MS degree from an Electrical and Computer Engineering / Telecom / Physics school,
Basic understanding of the physics of free space communication (especially: channel modeling),
Basic digital communication knowledge (preferable),
Matlab (preferable), C or Python (alternatively),
Experimental skills to build an optical testbed and validate the model if time permits (preferable),
Strong written and spoken communications skills and the ability to participate in robust discussions in English (mandatory)."

Role description
Background:
With the advent of cloud networking, datacenters have become a key part of the Internet infrastructure. The growth of datacenters is not sustainable for instance in terms of energy consumption, as current all-electronic architectures do not scale. For this reason, Bell Labs has recently proposed a novel datacenter architecture relying on forward-looking optical concepts, namely, burst optical slot switching, which has the potential to pave the way for novel applications that require strong end-to-end service (capacity, latency) guarantees. Bell Labs has already demonstrated several main components of the novel architecture, but not all of them.
We are growing our team to further develop the project and are looking for new talents. As a Ph.D. student you will have to carry one or several of the following tasks, depending on your profile:
Real-time control plane: implement and validate on a real-time FPGA-based embedded system: scheduling policies and other performance-related mechanisms to decrease network latency;
SDN control plane: implement and validate missing modules in a standard SDN controller environment for instance distributed resource allocation, hierarchical control of multidomain networks, etc.
Machine learning-based control plane: based on monitoring information by data center elements, adjust resource allocation in quasi real-time.
Application level: set up applications for distributed data centers to emulate a real load. Adapt existing protocols to the specifics of our prototype. Compare performance between legacy data centers and our prototype.

Duration: 3 years.

Contexte et atouts du poste
Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) constitute a promising tool for translating brain activity into commands to external devices. BCIs rely on the use of classification methods to discriminate the subject’s mental state allowing to interact with external world bypassing muscles (sites.google.com/site/devicofallanifabrizio/outreach-1). Typical clinical applications are nonverbal communication, prosthesis control, and neurofeedback-based motor rehabilitation.
Despite the potential, BCIs outside the laboratory are difficult to use, which reduces their social and clinical impact. One of the main limitations is the high intra/inter-subject variability in terms of BCI performance, as measured by the classification accuracy. The main aim of the project is to improve BCI performance by integrating new methods and algorithms developed by the team (sites.google.com/site/devicofallanifabrizio/Publications) into the Inria OpenVibe software (openvibe.inria.fr/).

Development of a configurable tool for the implementation of validation rules using existing APIs

Le/La titulaire de ce poste est chargé(e) du développement d'un outil configurable pour la mise en œuvre de règles de validation à l'aide des API existants.
Essential Responsibilities:
Within GE Renewable Energy, the Application Engineering team is in charge of delivering advanced software solutions for Energy Management in Transmission, Distribution and Market areas.

CIMNet is the Network analysis and validation module. It provides a collection of high-performance functionalities necessary to ensure fast and efficient Network Model verification in terms of consistency and network security, leveraging almost 40 years of experience in efficient and reliable network analysis algorithms by GE. CIMNet has been designed as a flexible multipurpose application. Its fast and high-quality CIM-based Network analysis modules can be used to quickly validate the Master models imported and/or modified in Source, as they can be used independently to load, merge and run Power Systems calculations from CGMES files. It is therefore the perfect solution to cover all model validation, Model merge and advanced network analysis business requirements of TSOs and RSCs

CIMNET was certified for full support of CGMES models including detailed HVDC data processing using the first version of ENTSOE conformity rules and these conformity rules are changing and expanding all over the years.

The purpose of this apprenticeship is to extend existing validation rules implemented in CIMNet with a complementary tool providing further possibilities to implement new rules from ENTSOE with high degree of configurability using CIMNet APIs.



The intern will be required to:
Understand the APIs or extension points available in CIMNET,
Understand the existing validation rules from ENTSOE with a support of Power Systems engineers from the team.
Design and develop this new configurable tool for the implementation of validation rules.
Provide all required documentations: detail User Guide, validation test book and online help.


Duration of the apprenticeship : 1-2 years

Principales responsabilités :

Au sein de GE Renewable Energy, l'équipe Ingénierie d'applications est chargée de développer des solutions logicielles avancées dédiées à la gestion de l'énergie dans les domaines de la transmission, de la distribution et du marché de réseaux électriques.



CIMNet est le module utilisé pour l'analyse et la validation de réseau. Il offre un ensemble de fonctionnalités ultra-performantes qui garantissent une vérification rapide et efficace du modèle de réseau en matière de cohérence et de sécurité, et qui s'appuient sur l'expérience de GE qui développe depuis 40 ans des algorithmes d'analyse de réseau à la fois fiables et efficaces. CIMNet a été conçu comme une application polyvalente et flexible. Ses modules d'analyse de réseau basés sur CIM sont rapides et de haute qualité, et peuvent être utilisés pour valider en un clin d'œil les modèles originaux importés et/ou modifiés dans Source. Ils peuvent également être utilisés indépendamment pour charger, combiner et exécuter les calculs Power Systems à partir de fichiers CGMES. Il s'agit donc de la solution parfaite pour couvrir toutes les exigences en matière de validation de modèle, de combinaison de modèles et d'analyse de réseau avancée des TSO et RSC



Le module CIMNET a été certifié pour la prise en charge des modèles CGMES, y compris pour le traitement des données HVDC détaillées, à l'aide de la première version des règles de conformité ENTSOE, règles de conformité qui évoluent et s'étoffent au fil des années.


L'objectif de cet apprentissage est d'étendre les règles de validation existantes et mises en œuvre au niveau du module CIMNet en créant un outil complémentaire offrant davantage de possibilités d'implémenter de nouvelles règles à partir des règles ENTSOE, avec de nombreuses options de configuration et en utilisant les API CIMNet.

In this position, you will have to regularly learn and use new APIs and identify their limitations (security, performance, usability, etc.), in order to design the best possible integration with DSS.

You will be developing production-ready code using the best software engineering practices as well as writing the associated technical documentation and tutorials.

You’ll be working alongside Software engineers, Product managers and UX designers. You will be responsible for API clients and content targeted at developers working with Dataiku DSS.

DSS is a machine-learning platform that connects together all big data technologies. We work with all major cloud services, SQL databases, NoSQL databases, Hadoop, Spark, MLLib, scikit-learn, Shiny, … and many more. Basically, our technological stack includes most of the Big Data and Machine Learning landscape.

One of the most unique characteristics of DSS is the breadth of its scope and the fact that it caters both to data analysts (with visual analytics) and data scientists (with deep integration in code and libraries, and a web-based IDE).

You will work primarily with Python, R, Javascript and Java, but also possibly with C#, Julia and many more programming languages.

This is a full-time position, primarily based in Paris, France.
You will
Develop and maintain the Python and SDK wrapping the DSS REST API, so that all new features are easily available to external developers
Build SDKs for additional programming languages (starting with Javascript)
Extend these SDKs with additional helpers and tools to improve the lives of developers working with our platform, based on their feedback.
Ensure that our API documentation are accurate, easy to understand, and are truly helping developers
Own and develop the various code samples available in DSS and its documentation (ranging from HelloWorld to Deep Learning models), focusing on solving real problems and bringing immediate value to developers
Be the go-to expert for anything related to developing in or for DSS
To fulfill its mission, Dataiku is growing fast (having just closed a $101 million Series C round in December 2018 and looking to double in 2019), but still maintains a startup spirit. Dataiku serves its global customer base from its headquarters in New York City as well as offices in Paris, London, Munich, Singapore, and Sydney. Each of our offices has a unique culture, but underpinning local nuances, we always value curiosity, collaboration, and can-do attitudes."

Our world is witnessing the emergence of means of communication with unmatched performance.
In the very near future, humans and machines will be instantly connected using applications that will combine
connectivity, speed, and reliability.
The rollout of 5G for everybody will pave the way for the connected car, the configurable factory, medical
applications, or drone taxis, to name but a few. It will mean the emergence of a world, whether urban or rural, united
by means of communication that will completely change our current way of life.
Geopolitical tensions will also increase the need to keep a closer eye on our planet, be it via drones, observation
satellites, radar, or state-of-the-art technology, to ensure our safety.
All the major players in the civil telecommunications sector, as well as aerospace and defense, already trust our
Group to bring them the fast, precise instrumentation they need to develop their products.
Driven by the rollout of 5G in civil telecommunications and the new challenges tied to aerospace and defense, our

Munich, Manchester, and Gothenburg. All the Group’s subsidiaries work together on a daily basis to satisfy their
customers. In fact, managing one program typically requires contributions from five subsidiaries!
Ever since the company was first created, MVG has placed particular importance on promoting an atmosphere that
is conducive to professional growth. Just some of the things we offer are top-tier health insurance and an ideal
working environment, which includes discussion and break rooms.
The Group believes that the variety of its employees' skills, cultures, training backgrounds, and talents is an asset,
and contributes to the innovative nature and success of its projects. MVG offers a development model that is deeply
rooted in cultivating talent and a desire to work on and develop new products.

360Learning, scale-up ed-tech fondée en 2013, accompagne les entreprises dans leur transformation en organisation apprenante. Pour SNCF, Air Canada, Kingfisher, comme pour nos 1200 autres clients à travers le monde, apprendre au quotidien devient une évidence. Et pour soutenir une croissance annuelle de plus de 100%, 2019 verra nos équipes doubler de taille (de 110 à 230 employés) et s’internationaliser de Paris à New York, en passant par Londres, toujours plus près de nos clients. En pleine hypercroissance, 360Learning a besoin de recruter des top performers : motivés, ambitieux et compétitifs, et à la fois bienveillants, calmes, rationnels et analytiques. Les parcours “fast track” sont courants chez nous !

Notre modèle d'organisation

Pour soutenir cette croissance, nous avons mis en place un modèle d'organisation nommé Convexity, qui vise à maximiser l’autonomie, la capacité d’initiative et la responsabilisation de chacun, des plus jeunes aux plus expérimentés.

Pour cela, Convexity met l’accent sur la définition de la mission et du périmètre de chacun, et produit ce que l’on appelle un “low authority environment” : chez 360Learning, une fois l’onboarding passé, vous êtes entièrement owner de votre périmètre et de vos décisions à l’intérieur de celui-ci ! Vous êtes seul responsable de vos choix, et de vos résultats.

La transparence est également de mise, l’information business étant la propriété de tous, elle est loguée et partagée dans Trello : à vous aussi de respecter ces règles et de créer la transparence sur votre activité aussi !Le modèle Convexity est particulièrement adapté si vous êtes très autonome, plutôt introverti, rigoureux, analytique et calme, vous avez une grande capacité d’exécution, et si la bienveillance n’est pas juste un mot pour vous, mais un objectif concret dans vos actions quotidiennes. Vous vous reconnaissez ? Alors vous avez probablement un brillant avenir chez 360Learning !"

At Criteo, we connect 1.5 billion active shoppers with the things they need and love. Our technology takes an algorithmic approach to predict what user we show an ad to, when, and for what products. Our dataset is about 50 petabytes in Hadoop (more than 120 TB extra per day) and we take less than 10ms to respond to an ad request. This is truly big data and machine learning without the buzzwords. If scale and complexity excite you, join us.

Most of all, we are creators. From designing ground-breaking products to finding unique ways to solve technical challenges at an exceptional scale, our tech teams work with state of the art methodologies to shape the future of advertising.

The Software Engineering team builds the products that make Criteo tick: from developing industry leading machine learning techniques, to building high scale/low latency real-time applications (over 5M qps, handling over 300 Bn HTTP requests daily), to delivering first class client interfaces, both API and UI, with forward-thinking UX at their core, all using state of the art technology.

What you'll do

All new Criteo products are built in a self-service first perspective, which help us collect clients' feedback as quickly as possible to make them autonomous.
The Budget & Webapps Engineering team holds a central position and provides technical solutions for UI/APIs used by both advertisers and publishers’ platforms. More specifically, we provide both product (Budget configuration APIs & external APIs) and technical (Analytics) pipelines. In partnership with Product and R&D teams, you will be working on the whole Criteo data flow: from Kafka streams (Flink), designing jobs running on the HDFS on our Hadoop cluster, building both internal & external REST services to access this data. Other topics we cover include: authentication,
analytics using Elasticsearch, emailing solutions etc. The biggest challenge is that we need to work across the whole Criteo stack. This requires a general knowledge on how to build APIs and know your way around both streaming and batch processing.

As a software engineer, you are able to:
Understand the functional needs from Product & R&D
Write technical specs, design and implement systems to match those
expectations
Test with unitary, integration and end to end tests and provide quality
monitoring
Review code of team members to ensure we commit only high-quality
code
Continuously deploy the applications

This is only part of the job. Using the information collected through meetups and conferences, you strengthen our system by building a state-of-the-art application, whether in terms of framework or library, or in terms of best practices (testing, continuous integration/deployment strategies).
Our current stack is built around .NET CORE, running in marathon containers on Mesos, Java/Scala written jobs running on the cluster, Python, Flink library, Elasticsearch.

Who you are
You are knowledgeable about REST APIs and data pipelines
You are curious about new technologies, eventually leading personal subjects on the matter
You have experience with developing and extending large and complex systems
You have worked in Agile environments and are passionate about shipping high quality code!
You understand the notion of a design system and have already worked on it

We’re looking for talented Account Executives in Paris to join the dots between our track and engaged accounts to reach out, build rapport, and spot new business opportunities. This is first and foremost a hunter role that requires you to generate new business opportunities and to run the full sales cycle to close.
Most sales team still work cold list noisy ""one-size-fit-all-account"" cadences to “hit” and reach new accounts. Painful, isn’t it? Reaching people who don’t know you or aren’t looking to buy can be tedious and painful. At Hull, we practice what we teach (which we learn from our customers using our platform). Business development is about engaging people who are already in the market, show intent and are considered best-fit.
When people indicate they’re interested in meeting to discuss how Hull can help integrate their tools, teams & data, you’ll be owning and leading sales cycles from chat conversations, demo requests qualification, social outreach, and email responses — to running Hull product demos. You will own the account from initial intent to closed won.
To understand a little more where our heads are at on ""next-level"" of sales development:
Read our blog post on sales enablement: https://www.hull.io/blog/sales-enablement/
Watch our presentation on rules-based growth: https://www.turingfest.com/2018/speakers/ed-fry

Nowhere is this more painful than in scaling B2B SaaS companies. Hull should be the single source of truth for all these companies. And you can own a key role in driving business to step up and help us join the dots.
If you “get it” too, we’d love to hear from you.

RESPONSIBILITIES
This is first and foremost a hunter role. You’ll be actively prospecting new business opportunities, as well as developing and up-selling current clients.
Responsible for the overall business development, and sales lifecycle of the Hull platform
Conduct in-depth research to identify lead opportunities and present sales strategies to Hull sales leadership
Document and track all potential and existing client interactions and lead follow-through using Hull, Salesforce, Intercom, and Outreach

Requirements
Native French speaker, English (fluent)

Uber Elevate is working toward transforming the world through aerial ridesharing at scale:
on-demand aviation has the potential to radically improve urban mobility, giving people back time lost in their daily commutes. Just as skyscrapers allowed cities to use limited land more efficiently, urban air transportation will use three-dimensional airspace to alleviate transportation congestion on the ground. A network of small, electric aircraft that take off and land vertically (called VTOL aircraft for Vertical Take-off and Landing, and pronounced vee-tol), will enable rapid, reliable transportation between suburbs and cities and, ultimately, within cities. Planned for 2023, UberAir will allow riders to tap a button and get a flight in three partner cities including Dallas and Los Angeles.

About the Role

Uber Elevate's Advanced Technologies Center (ATCP) is focused on advancing the state of knowledge in digital sciences, and developing advanced technologies that can help make cities smarter, better, and more efficient places to live and work.

JOB
Talentsoft développe une solution web de gestion des Talents : notre outil est une suite de modules en mode SaaS qui assiste les équipes Ressources Humaines dans la gestion du recrutement, de la formation et de la gestion des carrières. Notre solution permet à 10 millions d’utilisateurs d’avoir un impact sur leur trajectoire professionnelle : avec Talentsoft, demander une mobilité, candidater sur un poste ouvert, se former en ligne ou bien piloter les rémunérations de son équipe se fait en quelques clics.

Pour concevoir, développer et faire évoluer cette solution, 200 ingénieurs travaillent chez Talentsoft ; chaque jour, ils améliorent les modules existants, et enrichissent la solution en développant les fonctionnalités qui permettront aux clients de mieux gérer leurs processus RH.

Les équipes techniques sont principalement composées de Développeurs qui développent en C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET. Certains sont passionnés par l’algorithmie, d’autres se forment petit à petit aux technologies Frontend. Actuellement, nous remplaçons des pans entiers de l’application par des composants ReactJS (démarche DesignSystem). On utilise SQL Server pour les bases de données, et la solution est hébergée sur Azure. Les squads fonctionnent toutes en Agile (SCRUM ou Kanban), et on essaye tous d’appliquer les principes DevOps pour délivrer en continu.

Une journée-type dans la vie d’un Développeur chez Talentsoft :

De bon matin, tu participes au Stand Up Meeting,
Avec ta squad, vous vous fixez des objectifs réalistes pour la journée,
Au cours de la journée, tu passes du temps sur ton clavier : tu développes de nouvelles features, tu améliore une fonctionnalité existante ou bien tu refactores du code. Tu travailles en solo, ou bien avec ton « Peer »,
Quand tu n’es pas sur ton clavier, alors tu échanges avec les membres de ta squad : un Product Owner, mais aussi un UX Designer, un Architecte et un Quality Engineer. Ensemble vous trouvez de nouvelles façons d’avancer dans la même direction,
Jour après jour, tu échanges avec les membres de ta guilde, qui travaillent sur d’autres parties de l’application, dans d’autres squads. Ainsi, tu apprends de nouvelles choses, chaque jour.
Tu profites de ton « free time » (20% de ton temps) pour te former sur de nouvelles technos, ou bien développer des side-projects.
PROFILE

Quelques exemples de projets en cours :
Nous remplaçons une partie de notre applicatif par des composants ReactJS, et nous modernisons la stack en remplaçant les Webforms par des technologies plus modernes,
Nous enrichissons notre SDK afin que des éditeurs tiers puissent créer des widgets directement à l’intérieur de notre applicatif, et nous créons une plateforme PaaS,

Our Values

Velocity
Learn Fast, Fail Fast, Fix fast
Embrace doubt, and consider mistakes a part of the learning experience.
Velocity is what makes us different from more established companies and our competitors. It is what makes us beat the competition, keep customers happy, and iterate until we have found the right way to move forward.
We are a Learning Organization above all, and we can't learn without making mistakes.
Iterate and Learn
Start with the smallest solution that works and build it end to end.
When in doubt, err towards the simplest, fastest way to move forward. The right way to build things isn't to build them piece by piece, it's to build smaller versions of them and iterate. Consider the User experience the one piece that must be delivered, and work backwards from there.
Unity
All working together towards the same goal
We believe in our team, and in their expertise. We built a team of incredibly smart individuals and we rely on each other for success.
Empathy
Think how your actions impact others
The ability to put ourselves in the place of our customers and other team members is what helps us drive the right decisions at every instant. **
Ownership & Accountability
Nothing wrong with making mistakes
We believe empowering people brings positive change. We each own our decisions and actions, and we are responsible for creating value that derives from those actions.
Clarity & Transparency
Say what you do, do what you say
We believe in a culture of Transparency. We do things in the open. We're also responsible for making sure others are aware of what we're working on, and the help we need to make it happen.
Balance
Work/life balance
Work/life balance is critical. No good things from breaking it. Enjoy your family and your life so you can bring your best self to work."
