Job Description
If you are looking for a 6-month internship that aims at deploying the Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) in a large scale environment, have a look to this offer and join our Systems MBSE methods and tools team in Toulouse.

Context
As part of the Digital Design Manufacturing and Services (DDMS) initiative in Airbus, the « End-to-End Systems MBSE » project aims at transformation the community developping the embedded systems towards the MBSE.
To do so, we are deploying a large asset of interconnected systems architectures, using, for instance, the Dassault Systèmes 3Dx toolset.
Your mission
As the set of data is growing bigger, it becomes difficult to a have a global view of the architectures through the use of specialized, local authoring tools.
At the same time, we need to establish various viewpoints on these architectures (Cost/weight, number of equipment, number and complexity of interfaces, grouping according to Development Assurance Level, …) with the computation of associated indicators, in order to support trade-offs.
In the project team, you'll be in charge to study and to prototype the setup of an Architectures Dashboard, gathering Key Indicators and visuals related to qualities of the architectures we are deploying:
Establishing the needs for visualization of data related to embedded systems architectures
Starting from the various Use Cases planned for the Overall Systems Architecture Modelling (OSAM) in 3Dx, this phase will consist in the identification of the various stakeholders and to collect their needs in terms of viewpoints and associated indicators
Studying existing data visualization tools, both from the 3Dx toolset (Exalead), and the global community (Tom Sawyer, Kibana, Gephi, Yed, …)
This study should consider these tools as stand-alone tools, but also as part of current environments such as Airbus MBSE Lab or in connection to environment such as Capella.
The adequacy of each tool for the computation and representation of the indicators will be evaluated.
From this first filtering, a small demonstration will be built with the two most appropriate tools and presented back to the stakeholders.
One of the tool will then be selected for the next phase.
Prototyping an Architecture Dashboard using the selected tool, in connection with 3Dx as a data source
The content of this dashboard will be defined from the set of indicators defined from the stakeholders needs.
This dashboard should support flexible configuration as well as the possibility to deep-dive in the data sources.
Your boarding pass
Your technical background:
Master or engineer with Systems Engineering, MBSE or System Architecture design skills
Architecture modelling formalism (3Dx FLD, eFFBD, SysML, AADL, Capella, Modelica, …)
IT skills especiallyin the 3Dx environment (XML, 3DXML, MapForce or XSLT) would be a plus
French and English fluent
Most of all, your personality is key:
Capability to analyse and synthetize

Tasks and Responsibilities :
You will be working under the supervision of your manager who will help you identify your professional objectives and support you in the development of your skills.
Modern aircraft are collecting a large amount of data during operations. Those data are a gold mine but should be processed on the ground and therefore require to be downloaded from the aircraft first.
This has a cost depending on a various amount of factors and Airbus would like to let the airline optimize this cost. Indeed the operator can tune multiple channels and multiple options that decide how to retrieve data down to the ground. For instance activate cellular network for non critical data, use ACARS network for time critical messages, emit only a fraction of the data, etc...
Those configurations are done on board the aircraft but a simple independent model can be built out of them. If we combine this model with the current knowledge of in service use cases then we are able to approximate a cost.
Your main activities will include:
You will build this configuration model by interviewing multiple actors and gather valuable datasets.
The intern will then set up a simple web application that allows to customize this model on the scale of a full fleet and that shows its effect on the outgoing traffic for each output channel (cellular, SATCOM...). With this app the Airbus will be able to try different combinations with the airline, watch the associated costs and let the airline decide what should be the optimal aircraft configuration depending on its data policy.
The internship will also be the opportunity to use the newest Airbus big data platform to develop this app.

Job Description
In the civil aviation, the phenomena of atmospheric turbulence in flight can represent disturbances for the passengers, the crew and can impact the aircraft itself. The frequency of these events tends to increase because of the air traffic increase and climate change. They can lead to in-flight turn back (return towards the starting airport), to diversions (in the event of medical emergency) or to block an aircraft on the ground (in the event of inspection and/or of repairs due to damage).

The current state of the art does not allow to detect and predict systematically this phenomenon in real time.

In this context, the objective of this PhD thesis is to investigate the contribution of techniques of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the identification and the prediction of atmospheric turbulences, by using the data sensor already present on aircraft (coming from various systems).

The objective is to alert the crew sufficiently early before the aircraft penetrates in a severe zone of turbulence so that it can avoid this zone if possible (or to apply the procedure associated with severe turbulences).
You will join Airbus during 3 years and your main tasks and responsibilities will include:

techniques of Learning Machine and Deep Learning to identify the phases of turbulence

You will have to share your time between the Airbus research department in Toulouse and the academic laboratory (IRIT, Toulouse). The time-sharing will be function of the activity in progress and priority
Main steps of this PhD are:

Bibliographical study of the phenomenon of turbulence in general
Bibliographical study of the techniques of AI adapted to the prediction of turbulence
Real cases of turbulence events (in service)
Identification of the more impacting sensors measurements (feature selection process)
After selection of the most influential parameters in the signature of turbulence, development of a set of algorithms of AI resulting from the bibliography
Optimization of the algorithms by optimum adjustments (thanks to the definition of relevant metric allowing to compare the various approaches)
Selection of the most promising algorithm, prototyping and massive validation on the test facilities
PhD thesis manuscript writing and submission
You will have the following skills and experience:
Master degree/Engineer in data processing or in data-processing mathematics
Knowledge and experiments in Artificial Intelligence
Knowledge in aeronautics operations would be appreciated
Intermediate level of English.

This job requires an awareness of any potential compliance risks and a commitment to act with integrity, as the foundation for the Company’s success, reputation and sustainable growth.

By submitting your CV or application you are consenting to Airbus using and storing information about you for monitoring purposes relating to your application or future employment. This information will only be used by Airbus.

Signaler cette offre d'emploi",Data Engineer,Toulouse,"When designing an aircraft, in order to guarantee optimal Handling Qualities (maneuverability, stability, etc.), it is necessary to correctly size the control surfaces (tail, fins, elevators ...) as well as the flight domain (minimum control speeds and forward/afterward cg limit).
To do this, desktop simulators are used, initially, to reproduce the different sizing maneuvers. These simulators usually use ""pre-flight"" models of the aircraft (engines, aerodynamics, inertia, ...).
These models present an intrinsic level of uncertainty, which will therefore determine the size of the surfaces as well as the flight range.
Vos responsabilités
The purpose of this internship is to develop a new module to assess the sensitivity of Handling Qualities criteria to uncertainties in the aircraft model. The module will be integrated in the current desktop simulator. The internship plan is as follows:
Study the desktop simulator architecture
Study the existing specification for the new module and update it, if necessary
Develop the new module: implement the different methods to inject and propagate uncertainties on the aircraft models, among the various possible choices (ex: deterministic sweep, Monte Carlo, etc.).
Code the post-processing to exploit the simulations data (regression tests, calculation of means and standard deviations ...)
Test the new module with on one use case: choose the aircraft and the Handling Qualities criteria to be evaluated, analyze the results
The trainee will have the opportunity to present the results to a major aeronautical manufacturer.

Experience with automated testing (TDD, Mocking, Unit/Functional/Integration)
Expert Knowledge of Internet technologies/and protocols
Expert knowledge of the Java language, platform, ecosystem and underlying concepts and constructs
Knowledge of common design patterns (IoC, GoF – not J2EE Pattern Library)
B.S. in Computer Science, Mathematics, or Engineering (or professional experience)
What we value as a team:
Code built for Performance and Scale
Solid engineering practices (e.g. design patterns, automated testing, fault-tolerant systems, KISS)
Leveraging Open Source
Agile development and tight interaction with business/operations
Automated testing
Developers who can navigate around a Linux box
Passion, technical expertise, and personal accomplishment
